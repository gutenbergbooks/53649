<p>The Walpoles of Houghton, in Norfolk, ten
miles from King's Lynn, were an ancient
family, tracing their pedigree to a certain Reginald
de Walpole who was living in the time of
William the Conqueror. Under Henry II.
there was a Sir Henry de Walpol of Houton
and Walpol; and thenceforward an orderly procession
of Henrys and Edwards and Johns (all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
'of Houghton') carried on the family name to
the coronation of Charles II., when, in return
for his vote and interest as a member of the
Convention Parliament, one Edward Walpole
was made a Knight of the Bath. This Sir
Edward was in due time succeeded by his son,
Robert, who married well, sat for Castle Rising,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
one of the two family boroughs (the other being
King's Lynn, for which his father had been
member), and reputably filled the combined
offices of county magnate and colonel of militia.
But his chief claim to distinction is that his
eldest son, also a Robert, afterwards became
the famous statesman and Prime Minister to
whose 'admirable prudence, fidelity, and success'
England owes her prosperity under the
first Hanoverians. It is not, however, with the
life of 'that corrupter of parliaments, that dissolute
tipsy cynic, that courageous lover of peace
and liberty, that great citizen, patriot, and statesman,'&mdash;to
borrow a passage from one of Mr.
Thackeray's graphic vignettes,&mdash;that these pages
are concerned. It is more material to their purpose
to note that in the year 1700, and on the
30th day of July in that year (being the day of the
death of the Duke of Gloucester, heir presump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>tive
to the crown of England), Robert Walpole,
junior, then a young man of three-and-twenty,
and late scholar of King's College, Cambridge,
took to himself a wife. The lady chosen was
Miss Catherine Shorter, eldest daughter of John
Shorter, of Bybrook, an old Elizabethan red-brick
house near Ashford in Kent. Her grandfather,
Sir John Shorter, had been Lord Mayor
of London under James II., and her father was
a Norway timber merchant, having his wharf
and counting-house on the Southwark side of
the Thames, and his town residence in Norfolk
Street, Strand, where, in all probability, his
daughter met her future husband. They had
a family of four sons and two daughters. One
of the sons, William, died young. The third
son, Horatio,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> or Horace, born, as he himself
tells us, on the 24th September, 1717, O. S., is
the subject of this memoir.</p>

<p>With the birth of Horace Walpole is connected
a scandal so industriously repeated by
his later biographers that (although it has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>received far more attention than it deserves) it
can scarcely be left unnoticed here. He had,
it is asserted, little in common, either in tastes
or appearance, with his elder brothers Robert
and Edward, and he was born eleven years after
the rest of his father's children. This led to a
suggestion which first found definite expression
in the <cite>Introductory Anecdotes</cite> supplied by Lady
Louisa Stuart to Lord Wharncliffe's edition of
the works of her grandmother, Lady Mary
Wortley Montagu.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It was to the effect that
Horace was not the son of Sir Robert Walpole,
but of one of his mother's admirers, Carr, Lord
Hervey, elder brother of Pope's 'Sporus,' the
Hervey of the <cite>Memoirs</cite>. It is advanced in
favour of this supposition that his likeness to
the Herveys, both physically and mentally, was
remarkable; that the whilom Catherine Shorter
was flighty, indiscreet, and fond of admiration;
and that Sir Robert's cynical disregard of his
wife's vagaries, as well as his own gallantries
(his second wife, Miss Skerret, had been his
mistress), were matters of notoriety. On the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>other hand, there is no indication that any suspicion
of his parentage ever crossed the mind of
Horace Walpole himself. His devotion to his
mother was one of the most consistent traits in
a character made up of many contradictions;
and although between the frail and fastidious
virtuoso and the boisterous, fox-hunting Prime
Minister there could have been but little sympathy,
the son seems nevertheless to have sedulously
maintained a filial reverence for his father,
of whose enemies and detractors he remained,
until his dying day, the implacable foe. Moreover,
it must be remembered that, admirable as
are Lady Louisa Stuart's recollections, in speaking
of Horace Walpole she is speaking of one
whose caustic pen and satiric tongue had never
spared the reputation of the vivacious lady
whose granddaughter she was.</p>

<p>With this reference to what can be, at best,
but an insoluble question, we may return to the
story of Walpole's earlier years. Of his childhood
little is known beyond what he has himself
told in the <cite>Short Notes of my Life</cite> which
he drew up for the use of Mr. Berry, the nominal
editor of his works.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> His godfathers, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>says, were the Duke of Grafton and his father's
second brother, Horatio, who afterwards became
Baron Walpole of Wolterton. His godmother
was his aunt, the beautiful Dorothy
Walpole, who, escaping the snares of Lord
Wharton, as related by Lady Louisa Stuart,
had become the second wife of Charles, second
Viscount Townshend. In 1724, he was 'inoculated
for the small-pox;' and in the following
year, was placed with his cousins, Lord Townshend's
younger sons, at Bexley, in Kent, under
the charge of one Weston, son to the Bishop of
Exeter of that name. In 1726, the same course
was pursued at Twickenham, and in the winter
months he went to Lord Townshend's. Much
of his boyhood, however, must have been spent
in the house 'next the College' at Chelsea, of
which his father became possessed in 1722. It
still exists in part, with but little alteration, as
the infirmary of the hospital, and Ward No. 7 is
said to have been its dining-room.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> With this,
or with some other reception-chamber at Chelsea,
is connected one of the scanty anecdotes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>this time. Once, when Walpole was a boy,
there came to see his mother one of those formerly
famous beauties chronicled by Anthony
Hamilton,&mdash;'la belle Jennings,' elder sister to
the celebrated Duchess of Marlborough, and
afterwards Duchess of Tyrconnell. At this date
she was a needy Jacobite seeking Lady Walpole's
interest in order to obtain a pension. She
no longer possessed those radiant charms which
under Charles had revealed her even through
the disguise of an orange-girl; and now, says
Walpole, annotating his own copy of the <cite>Memoirs
of Grammont</cite>, 'her eyes being dim, and
she full of flattery, she commended the beauty
of the prospect; but unluckily the room in
which they sat looked only against the garden-wall.'<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Another of the few events of his boyhood
which he records, illustrates the old proverb
that 'One half of the world knows not how the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>other half lives,' rather than any particular phase
of his biography. Going with his mother to buy
some bugles (beads), at the time when the opposition
to his father was at its highest, he notes
that having made her purchase,&mdash;beads were
then out of fashion, and the shop was in some
obscure alley in the City, where lingered unfashionable
things,&mdash;Lady Walpole bade the
shopman send it home. Being asked whither,
she replied, 'To Sir Robert Walpole's.' 'And
who,' rejoined he coolly, 'is Sir Robert Walpole?'<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
But the most interesting incident of
his youth was the visit he paid to the King,
which he has himself related in Chapter I. of
the <cite>Reminiscences</cite>. How it came about he does
not know, but at ten years old an overmastering
desire seized him to inspect His Majesty.
This childish caprice was so strong that his
mother, who seldom thwarted him, solicited the
Duchess of Kendal (the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maîtresse en titre</i>) to
obtain for her son the honour of kissing King
George's hand before he set out upon that visit
to Hanover from which he was never to return.
It was an unusual request, but being made by
the Prime Minister's wife, could scarcely be refused.
To conciliate etiquette and avoid precedent,
however, it was arranged that the audience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>should be in private and at night. 'Accordingly,
the night but one before the King began
his last journey [<i>i. e.</i>, on 1 June, 1727], my
mother carried me at ten at night to the apartment
of the Countess of Walsingham [Melusina
de Schulemberg, the Duchess's reputed niece],
on the ground floor, towards the garden at
St. James's, which opened into that of her
aunt, ... apartments occupied by George II.
after his Queen's death, and by his successive
mistresses, the Countesses of Suffolk [Mrs.
Howard] and Yarmouth [Madame de Walmoden].
Notice being given that the King was
come down to supper, Lady Walsingham took
me alone into the Duchess's ante-room, where
we found alone the King and her. I knelt down,
and kissed his hand. He said a few words to
me, and my conductress led me back to my
mother. The person of the King is as perfect
in my memory as if I saw him but yesterday.
It was that of an elderly man, rather pale, and
exactly like his pictures and coins; not tall; of
an aspect rather good than august; with a dark
tie-wig, a plain coat, waistcoat, and breeches of
snuff-coloured cloth, with stockings of the same
colour, and a blue ribband over all. So entirely
was he my object that I do not believe I once
looked at the Duchess; but as I could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
avoid seeing her on entering the room, I remember
that just beyond His Majesty stood a
very tall, lean, ill-favoured old lady; but I did
not retain the least idea of her features, nor
know what the colour of her dress was.'<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In
the <cite>Walpoliana</cite> (p. 25)<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Walpole is made to say
that his introducer was his father, and that the
King took him up in his arms and kissed him.
Walpole's own written account is the more
probable one. His audience must have been
one of the last the King granted, for, as already
stated, it was almost on the eve of his departure;
and ten days later, when his chariot clattered
swiftly into the courtyard of his brother's palace
at Osnabruck, he lay dead in his seat, and the
reign of his successor had begun.</p>

<p>Although Walpole gives us a description of
George I., he does not, of course, supply us
with any portrait of himself. But in Mr. Peter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>Cunningham's excellent edition of the <cite>Correspondence</cite>
there is a copy of an oil-painting belonging
(1857) to Mrs. Bedford of Kensington,
which, upon the faith of a Cupid who points
with an arrow to the number ten upon a dial,
may be accepted as representing him about the
time of the above interview. It is a full length
of a slight, effeminate-looking lad in a stiff-skirted
coat, knee-breeches, and open-breasted
laced waistcoat, standing in a somewhat affected
attitude at the side of the afore-mentioned sundial.
He has dark, intelligent eyes, and a profusion
of light hair curling abundantly about his
ears and reaching to his neck. If the date given
in the <cite>Short Notes</cite> be correct, he must have
already become an Eton boy, since he says that
he went to that school on the 26th April, 1727,
and he adds in the <cite>Reminiscences</cite> that he shed a
flood of tears for the King's death, when, 'with
the other scholars at Eton College,' he walked
in procession to the proclamation of his successor.
Of the cause of this emotion he seems
rather doubtful, leaving us to attribute it partly
to the King's condescension in gratifying his
childish loyalty, partly to the feeling that, as the
Prime Minister's son, it was incumbent on him
to be more concerned than his schoolfellows;
while the spectators, it is hinted, placed it to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
credit of a third and not less cogent cause,&mdash;the
probability of that Minister's downfall. Of
this, however, as he says, he could not have had
the slightest conception. His tutor at Eton
was Henry Bland, eldest son of the master
of the school. 'I remember,' says Walpole,
writing later to his relative and schoolfellow
Conway, 'when I was at Eton, and Mr. Bland
had set me an extraordinary task, I used sometimes
to pique myself upon not getting it,
because it was not immediately my school business.
What, learn more than I was absolutely
forced to learn! I felt the weight of learning
that, for I was a blockhead, and pushed up
above my parts.' That, as the son of the great
Minister, he was pushed, is probably true; but,
despite his own disclaimer, it is clear that his abilities
were by no means to be despised. Indeed,
one of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pièces justificatives</i> in the story of
Lady Louisa Stuart, though advanced for another
purpose, is distinctly in favour of something
more than average talent. Supporting her theory
as to his birth by the statement that in his boyhood
he was left so entirely in the hands of his
mother as to have little acquaintance with his
father, she goes on to say that 'Sir Robert
Walpole took scarcely any notice of him, till his
proficiency at Eton School, when a lad of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
standing, drew his attention, and proved that
whether he had or had not a right to the name
he went by, he was likely to do it honour.'<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
Whatever this may be held to prove, it certainly
proves that he was not the blockhead he declares
himself to have been.</p>

<p>Among his schoolmates he made many friends.
For his cousins, Henry (afterwards Marshal)
Conway and Lord Hertford, Conway's elder
brother, he formed an attachment which lasted
through life, and many of his best letters were
written to these relatives. Other associates
were the later lyrist, Charles Hanbury Williams,
and the famous wit, George Augustus Selwyn,
both of whom, if the child be father to the
man, must be supposed to have had unusual
attractions for their equally witty schoolmate.
Another contemporary at school, to whom, in
after life, he addressed many letters, was William
Cole, subsequently to develop into a laborious
antiquary, and probably already exhibiting
proclivities towards 'tall copies' and black
letter. But his chiefest friends, no doubt,
were grouped in the two bodies christened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>respectively the 'triumvirate' and the 'quadruple
alliance.'</p>

<p>Of these the 'triumvirate' was the less important.
It consisted of Walpole and the two sons of
Brigadier-General Edward Montagu. George,
the elder, afterwards M.P. for Northampton,
and the recipient of some of the most genuine
specimens of his friend's correspondence, is
described in advanced age as 'a gentleman-like
body of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vieille cour</i>,' usually attended by a
younger brother, who was still a midshipman at
the mature age of sixty, and whose chief occupation
consisted in carrying about his elder's
snuff-box. Charles Montagu, the remaining
member of the 'triumvirate,' became a Lieut.-General
and Knight of the Bath. But it was
George, who had 'a fine sense of humour, and
much curious information,' who was Walpole's
favourite. 'Dear George,'&mdash;he writes to him
from Cambridge,&mdash;'were not the playing fields
at Eton food for all manner of flights? No old
maid's gown, though it had been tormented
into all the fashions from King James to King
George, ever underwent so many transformations
as those poor plains have in my idea. At first
I was contented with tending a visionary flock,
and sighing some pastoral name to the echo of
the cascade under the bridge. How happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
should I have been to have had a kingdom only
for the pleasure of being driven from it, and
living disguised in an humble vale! As I got
further into Virgil and Clelia, I found myself
transported from Arcadia to the garden of Italy;
and saw Windsor Castle in no other view than
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Capitoli immobile saxum</i>.' Further on he
makes an admission which need scarcely surprise
us. 'I can't say I am sorry I was never quite
a schoolboy: an expedition against bargemen,
or a match at cricket, may be very pretty things
to recollect; but, thank my stars, I can remember
things that are very near as pretty. The
beginning of my Roman history was spent in
the asylum, or conversing in Egeria's hallowed
grove; not in thumping and pummelling King
Amulius's herdsmen.'<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The description seems
to indicate a schoolboy of a rather refined and
effeminate type, who would probably fare ill with
robuster spirits. But Walpole's social position
doubtless preserved him from the persecution
which that variety generally experiences at the
hands&mdash;literally the hands&mdash;of the tyrants of
the playground.</p>

<p>The same delicacy of organisation seems to
have been a main connecting link in the second
or 'quadruple alliance' already referred to,&mdash;an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>alliance, it may be, less intrinsically intimate, but
more obviously cultivated. The most important
figure in this quartet was a boy as frail and delicate
as Walpole himself, 'with a broad, pale
brow, sharp nose and chin, large eyes, and a
pert expression,' who was afterwards to become
famous as the author of one of the most popular
poems in the language, the <cite>Elegy written in
a Country Church Yard</cite>. Thomas Gray was at
this time about thirteen, and consequently somewhat
older than his schoolmate. Another
member of the association was Richard West,
also slightly older, a grandson of the Bishop
Burnet who wrote the <cite>History of My Own
Time</cite>, and son of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland.
West, a slim, thoughtful lad, was the
most precocious genius of the party, already
making verses in Latin and English, and making
them even in his sleep. The fourth member
was Thomas Ashton, afterwards Fellow of Eton
College and Rector of St. Botolph, Bishopsgate.
Such was the group which may be pictured
sauntering arm in arm through the Eton meadows,
or threading the avenue which is still
known as the 'Poet's Walk.' Each of the four
had his nickname, either conferred by himself
or by his schoolmates. Ashton, for example,
was Plato; Gray was Orosmades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>On 27 May, 1731, Walpole was entered at
Lincoln's Inn, his father intending him for the
law. 'But'&mdash;he says in the <cite>Short Notes</cite>&mdash;'I
never went thither, not caring for the profession.'
On 23 September, 1734, he left Eton
for good, and no further particulars of his school-days
remain. That they were not without their
pleasant memories may, however, be inferred
from the letters already quoted, and especially
from one to George Montagu written
some time afterwards upon the occasion of a
visit to the once familiar scenes. It is dated
from the Christopher Inn, a famous old hostelry,
well known to Eton boys,&mdash;'The Christopher.
How great I used to think anybody just landed
at the Christopher! But here are no boys for
me to send for; there I am, like Noah, just
returned into his old world again, with all sorts
of queer feels about me. By the way, the clock
strikes the old cracked sound; I recollect so
much, and remember so little; and want to
play about; and am so afraid of my playfellows;
and am ready to shirk Ashton; and
can't help <em>making fun</em> of myself; and envy a
dame over the way, that has just locked in her
boarders, and is going to sit down in a little hot
parlour to a very bad supper, so comfortably!
And I could be so jolly a dog if I did not <em>fat</em>,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>which,
by the way, is the first time the word was
ever applicable to me. In short, I should be
out of all <em>bounds</em> if I was to tell you half I
feel,&mdash;how young again I am one minute, and
how old the next. But do come and feel with
me, when you will,&mdash;to-morrow. Adieu! If
I don't compose myself a little more before
Sunday morning, when Ashton is to preach
['Plato' at the date of this letter had evidently
taken orders], I shall certainly <em>be in a bill for
laughing at church</em>; but how to help it, to see
him in the pulpit, when the last time I saw him
here was standing up funking over against a
conduit to be catechised.'<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>This letter, of which the date is not given,
but which Cunningham places after March,
1737, must have been written some time after
the writer had taken up his residence at Cambridge
in his father's college of King's.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> This
he did in March, 1735, following an interval of
residence in London. By this time the 'quad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>ruple
alliance' had been broken up by the
defection of West, who, much against his will,
had gone to Christ Church, Oxford. Ashton
and Gray had, however, been a year at Cambridge,
the latter as a fellow-commoner of
Peterhouse, the former at Walpole's own college,
King's. Cole and the Conways were
also at Cambridge, so that much of the old intercourse
must have been continued. Walpole's
record of his university studies is of the most
scanty kind. He does little more than give us
the names of his tutors, public and private. In
civil law he attended the lectures of Dr. Dickens
of Trinity Hall; in anatomy, those of Dr. Battie.
French, he says, he had learnt at Eton. His
Italian master at Cambridge was Signor Piazza
(who had at least an Italian name!), and his
instructor in drawing was the miniaturist Bernard
Lens, the teacher of the Duke of Cumberland
and the Princesses Mary and Louisa. Lens
was the author of a <cite>New and Complete Drawing
Book for curious young Gentlemen and Ladies
that study and practice the noble and commendable
Art of Drawing, Colouring, etc.</cite>, and is
kindly referred to in the later <cite>Anecdotes of
Painting</cite>. In mathematics, which Walpole seems
to have hated as cordially as Swift and Goldsmith
and Gray did, he sat at the feet of the blind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Professor Nicholas Saunderson, author of the
<cite>Elements of Algebra</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Years afterwards (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à
propos</i> of a misguided enthusiast who had put
the forty-seventh proposition of Euclid into
Latin verse) he tells one of his correspondents
the result of these ministrations: 'I ... was
always so incapable of learning mathematics
that I could not even get by heart the multiplication
table, as blind Professor Saunderson honestly
told me, above threescore years ago, when
I went to his lectures at Cambridge. After the
first fortnight he said to me, 'Young man, it
would be cheating you to take your money; for
you can never learn what I am trying to teach
you.' I was exceedingly mortified, and cried;
for, being a Prime Minister's son, I had firmly
believed all the flattery with which I had been
assured that my parts were capable of anything.
I paid a private instructor for a year; but, at
the year's end, was forced to own Saunderson
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>had been in the right.'<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> This private instructor
was in all probability Mr. Trevigar, who,
Walpole says, read lectures to him in mathematics
and philosophy. From other expressions
in his letters, it must be inferred that his progress
in the dead languages, if respectable, was
not brilliant. He confesses, on one occasion,
his inability to help Cole in a Latin epitaph, and
he tells Pinkerton that he never was a good
Greek scholar.</p>


<p>His correspondence at this period, chiefly
addressed to West and George Montagu, is
not extensive, but it is already characteristic.
In one of his letters to Montagu he encloses a
translation of a little French dialogue between
a turtle-dove and a passer-by. The verses are
of no particular merit, but in the comment one
recognizes a cast of style soon to be familiar.
'You will excuse this gentle nothing, I mean
mine, when I tell you I translated it out of
pure good-nature for the use of a disconsolate
wood-pigeon in our grove, that was made a
widow by the barbarity of a gun. She coos
and calls me so movingly, 'twould touch your
heart to hear her. I protest to you it grieves
me to pity her. She is so allicholly<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> as any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>thing. I'll warrant you now she's as sorry as
one of us would be. Well, good man, he's
gone, and he died like a lamb. She's an unfortunate
woman, but she must have patience.'<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> In
another letter to West, after expressing his
astonishment that Gray should be at Burnham
in Buckinghamshire, and yet be too indolent to
revisit the old Eton haunts in his vicinity, he
goes on to gird at the university curriculum.
At Cambridge, he says, they are supposed to
betake themselves 'to some trade, as logic,
philosophy, or mathematics.' But he has been
used to the delicate food of Parnassus, and
can never condescend to the grosser studies
of Alma Mater. 'Sober cloth of syllogism
colour suits me ill; or, what's worse, I hate
clothes that one must prove to be of no colour
at all. If the Muses <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cœlique vias et sidera
monstrent</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quâ vi maria alta tumescant</i>;
why <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">accipiant</i>: but 'tis thrashing, to study
philosophy in the abstruse authors. I am not
against cultivating these studies, as they are
certainly useful; but then they quite neglect all
polite literature, all knowledge of this world.
Indeed, such people have not much occasion for
this latter; for they shut themselves up from it,
and study till they know less than any one.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>Great mathematicians have been of great use;
but the generality of them are quite unconversible:
they frequent the stars, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub pedibusque
vident nubes</i>, but they can't see through
them. I tell you what I see; that by living
amongst them, I write of nothing else: my letters
are all parallelograms, two sides equal to
two sides; and every paragraph an axiom,
that tells you nothing but what every mortal
almost knows.'<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> In an earlier note he has
been on a tour to Oxford, and, with a premonition
of the future connoisseur of Strawberry
Hill, criticises the gentlemen's seats on
the road. 'Coming back, we saw Easton
Neston [in Northamptonshire], a seat of Lord
Pomfret, where in an old greenhouse is a
wonderful fine statue of Tully, haranguing a
numerous assemblage of decayed emperors, vestal
virgins with new noses, Colossus's, Venus's,
headless carcases and carcaseless heads, pieces
of tombs, and hieroglyphics.'<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> A little later
he has been to his father's seat at Houghton:
'I am return'd again to Cambridge, and can
tell you what I never expected,&mdash;that I like
Norfolk. Not any of the ingredients, as Hunting
or Country Gentlemen, for I had nothing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>do with them, but the county; which a little
from Houghton is woody, and full of delightfull
prospects. I went to see Norwich and
Yarmouth, both which I like exceedingly. I
spent my time at Houghton for the first week
almost alone. We have a charming garden, all
wilderness; much adapted to my Romantick
inclinations.' In after life the liking for Norfolk
here indicated does not seem to have
continued, especially when his father's death
had withdrawn a part of its attractions. He
'hated Norfolk,'&mdash;says Mr. Cunningham.
'He did not care for Norfolk ale, Norfolk
turnips, Norfolk dumplings, or Norfolk turkeys.
Its flat, sandy, aguish scenery was not to his
taste.' He preferred 'the rich blue prospects'
of his mother's county, Kent.</p>

<p>Of literary effort while at Cambridge, Walpole's
record is not great. In 1736, he was one
of the group of university poets&mdash;Gray and
West being also of the number&mdash;who addressed
congratulatory verses to Frederick, Prince of
Wales, upon his marriage with the Princess
Augusta of Saxe-Gotha; and he wrote a poem
(which is reprinted in vol. i. of his works) to
the memory of the founder of King's College,
Henry VI. This is dated 2 February, 1738.
In the interim Lady Walpole died. Her son's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
references to his loss display the most genuine
regret. In a letter to Charles Lyttelton (afterwards
the well-known Dean of Exeter, and
Bishop of Carlisle), which is not included in
Cunningham's edition, and is apparently dated
in error September, 1732, instead of 1737,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
he dwells with much feeling on 'the surprizing
calmness and courage which my dear Mother
show'd before her death. I believe few women
wou'd behave so well, &amp; I am certain no man
cou'd behave better. For three or four days
before she dyed, she spoke of it with less
indifference than one speaks of a cold; and
while she was sensible, which she was within
her two last hours, she discovered no manner
of apprehension.' That his warm affection for
her was well known to his friends may be
inferred from a passage in one of Gray's letters
to West: 'While I write to you, I hear the
bad news of Lady Walpole's death on Saturday
night last [20 Aug., 1737]. Forgive me if the
thought of what my poor Horace must feel on
that account, obliges me to have done.'<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Lady
Walpole was buried in Westminster Abbey,
where, on her monument in Henry VIIth's
Chapel, may be read the piously eulogistic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>inscription which her youngest son composed
to her memory,&mdash;an inscription not easy to
reconcile in all its terms with the current
estimate of her character. But in August,
1737, she was considerably over fifty, and had
probably long outlived the scandals of which
she had been the subject in the days when
Kneller and Eckardt painted her as a young
and beautiful woman.</p>

<p>That, in those piping days of patronage,
when even very young ladies of quality
drew pay as cornets of horse, the son of the
Prime Minister of England should be left unprovided
for, was not to be expected. While
he was still resident at Cambridge, lucrative
sinecures came to Horace Walpole. Soon
after his mother's death, his father appointed
him Inspector of Imports and Exports in the
Custom House,&mdash;a post which he resigned in
January, 1738, on succeeding Colonel William
Townshend as Usher of the Exchequer. When,
later in the year, he came of age (17 September),
he 'took possession of two other little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
patent-places in the Exchequer, called Comptroller
of the Pipe, and Clerk of the Estreats,'
which had been held for him by a substitute.
In 1782, when he still filled them, the two
last-mentioned offices produced together about
£300 per annum, while the Ushership of the
Exchequer, at the date of his obtaining it,
was reckoned to be worth £900 a year.
'From that time [he says] I lived on my
own income, and travelled at my own expense;
nor did I during my father's life receive from
him but £250 at different times,&mdash;which I say
not in derogation of his extreme tenderness
and goodness to me, but to show that I was
content with what he had given to me, and
that from the age of twenty I was no charge
to my family.'<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>He continued at King's College for some
time after he had attained his majority, only
quitting it formally in March, 1739, not without
regretful memories of which his future
correspondence was to bear the traces. If
he had neglected mathematics, and only moderately
courted the classics, he had learnt
something of the polite arts and of modern
Continental letters,&mdash;studies which would naturally
lead his inclination in the direction of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>the inevitable 'Grand Tour.' Two years
earlier he had very unwillingly declined an
invitation from George Montagu and Lord
Conway to join them in a visit to Italy. Since
that date his desire for foreign travel, fostered
no doubt by long conversations with Gray,
had grown stronger, and he resolved to see
'the palms and temples of the south' after
the orthodox eighteenth-century fashion. To
think of Gray in this connection was but
natural, and he accordingly invited his friend
(who had now quitted Cambridge, and was
vegetating rather disconsolately in his father's
house on Cornhill) to be his travelling companion.
Walpole was to act as paymaster;
but Gray was to be independent. Furthermore,
Walpole made a will under which, if he
died abroad, Gray was to be his sole legatee.
Dispositions so advantageous and considerate
scarcely admitted of refusal, even if Gray had
been backward, which he was not. The two
friends accordingly set out for Paris. Walpole
makes the date of departure 10 March, 1739;
Gray says they left Dover at twelve on the
29th.</p>

<p>The first records of the journey come from
Amiens in a letter written by Gray to his
mother. After a rough passage across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Straits, they reached Calais at five. Next day
they started for Boulogne in the then new-fangled
invention, a post-chaise,&mdash;a vehicle
which Gray describes 'as of much greater use
than beauty, resembling an ill-shaped chariot,
only with the door opening before instead of
[at] the side.' Of Boulogne they see little,
and of Montreuil (where later Sterne engaged
La Fleur) Gray's only record, besides the
indifferent fare, is that 'Madame the hostess
made her appearance in long lappets of bone
lace, and a sack of linsey-woolsey.' From
Montreuil they go by Abbeville to Amiens,
where they visit the cathedral, and the chapels
of the Jesuits and Ursuline Nuns. But the
best part of this first letter is the little picture
with which it (or rather as much of it as
Mason published) concludes. 'The country
we have passed through hitherto has been
flat, open, but agreeably diversified with villages,
fields well cultivated, and little rivers.
On every hillock is a windmill, a crucifix, or
a Virgin Mary dressed in flowers and a sarcenet
robe; one sees not many people or
carriages on the road; now and then indeed
you meet a strolling friar, a countryman with
his great muff, or a woman riding astride on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
little ass, with short petticoats, and a great
head-dress of blue wool.'<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The foregoing letter is dated the 1st April,
and it speaks of reaching Paris on the 3rd.
But it was only on the evening of Saturday
the 9th that they rolled into the French
capital, 'driving through the streets a long
while before they knew where they were.'
Walpole had wisely resolved not to hurry,
and they had besides broken down at Luzarches,
and lingered at St. Denis over the
curiosities of the abbey, particularly a vase of
oriental onyx carved with Bacchus and the
nymphs, of which they had dreamed ever
since. At Paris, they found a warm welcome
among the English residents,&mdash;notably from
Mason's patron, Lord Holdernesse, and Walpole's
cousins, the Conways. They seem to
have plunged at once into the pleasures of the
place,&mdash;pleasures in which, according to Walpole,
cards and eating played far too absorbing a
part. At Lord Holdernesse's they met at supper
the famous author of <cite>Manon Lescaut</cite>, M. l'Abbé
Antoine-François Prévost d'Exilles, who had
just put forth the final volume of his tedious
and scandalous <cite>Histoire de M. Cléveland, fils
naturel de Cromwel</cite>. They went to the spec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>tacle
of <cite>Pandore</cite> at the Salle des Machines of
the Tuileries; and they went to the opera,
where they saw the successful <cite>Ballet de la Paix</cite>,&mdash;a
curious hotchpot, from Gray's description,
of cracked voices and incongruous mythology.
With the Comédie Française they were better
pleased, although Walpole, strange to say, unlike
Goldsmith ten years later, was not able to commend
the performance of Molière's <cite>L'Avare</cite>.
They saw Mademoiselle Gaussin (as yet unrivalled
by the unrisen Mademoiselle Clairon)
in La Noue's tragedy of <cite>Mahomet Second</cite>, then
recently produced, with Dufresne in the leading
male part; and they also saw the prince of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits-maîtres</i>, Grandval, acting with Dufresne's
sister, Mademoiselle Jeanne-Françoise Quinault
(an actress 'somewhat in Mrs. Clive's
way,' says Gray), in the <cite>Philosophe marié</cite> of
Nericault Destouches,&mdash;a charming comedy
already transferred to the English stage in the
version by John Kelly of <cite>The Universal
Spectator</cite>.</p>

<p>Theatres, however, are not the only amusements
which the two travellers chronicle to
the home-keeping West. A great part of
their time is spent in seeing churches and
palaces full of pictures. Then there is the
inevitable visit to Versailles, which, in sum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
they concur in condemning. 'The great
front,' says Walpole, 'is a lumber of littleness,
composed of black brick, stuck full of
bad old busts, and fringed with gold rails.'
Gray (he says) likes it; but Gray is scarcely
more complimentary,&mdash;at all events is quite
as hard upon the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">façade</i>, using almost the
same phrases of depreciation. It is 'a huge
heap of littleness,' in hue 'black, dirty red,
and yellow; the first proceeding from stone
changed by age; the second, from a mixture
of brick; and the last, from a profusion of
tarnished gilding. You cannot see a more
disagreeable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout ensemble</i>; and, to finish the
matter, it is all stuck over in many places
with small busts of a tawny hue between
every two windows.' The garden, however,
pleases him better; nothing could be vaster
and more magnificent than the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d'œil</i>, with
its fountains and statues and grand canal. But
the 'general taste of the place' is petty and
artificial. 'All is forced, all is constrained
about you; statues and vases sowed everywhere
without distinction; sugar-loaves and
minced pies of yew; scrawl work of box, and
little squirting <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jets d'eau</i>, besides a great sameness
in the walks,&mdash;cannot help striking one at
first sight; not to mention the silliest of laby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>rinths,
and all Æsop's fables in water.'<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> 'The
garden is littered with statues and fountains,
each of which has its tutelary deity. In particular,
the elementary god of fire solaces himself
in one. In another, Enceladus, in lieu of a
mountain, is overwhelmed with many waters.
There are avenues of water-pots, who disport
themselves much in squirting up cascadelins.
In short, 'tis a garden for a great child.'<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
The day following, being Whitsunday, they
witness a grand ceremonial,&mdash;the installation
of nine Knights of the Saint Esprit: 'high
mass celebrated with music, great crowd, much
incense, King, Queen, Dauphin, Mesdames,
Cardinals, and Court; Knights arrayed by His
Majesty; reverences before the altar, not bows,
but curtsies; stiff hams; much tittering among
the ladies; trumpets, kettle-drums, and fifes.'<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>It is Gray who thus summarises the show.
But we must go to Walpole for the account of
another expedition, the visit to the Convent of
the Chartreux, the uncouth horror of which,
with its gloomy chapel and narrow cloisters,
seems to have fascinated the Gothic soul of the
future author of the <cite>Castle of Otranto</cite>. Here,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>in one of the cells, they make the acquaintance
of a fresh initiate into the order,&mdash;the account
of whose environment suggests retirement rather
than solitude. 'He was extremely civil, and
called himself Dom Victor. We have promised
to visit him often. Their habit is all white: but
besides this he was infinitely clean in his person;
and his apartment and garden, which he keeps
and cultivates without any assistance, was neat
to a degree. He has four little rooms, furnished
in the prettiest manner, and hung with good
prints. One of them is a library, and another a
gallery. He has several canary-birds disposed
in a pretty manner in breeding-cages. In his
garden was a bed of good tulips in bloom,
flowers and fruit-trees, and all neatly kept.
They are permitted at certain hours to talk to
strangers, but never to one another, or to go
out of their convent.' In the same institution
they saw Le Sueur's history (in pictures) of St.
Bruno, the founder of the Chartreux. Walpole
had not yet studied Raphael at Rome, but
these pictures, he considered, excelled everything
he had seen in England and Paris.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>'From thence [Paris],' say Walpole's <cite>Short
Notes</cite>, 'we went with my cousin, Henry Conway,
to Rheims, in Champagne, [and] staid there three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>months.' One of their chief objects was to
improve themselves in French. 'You must not
wonder,' he tells West, 'if all my letters resemble
dictionaries, with French on one side, and
English on t'other; I deal in nothing else at
present, and talk a couple of words of each
language alternately from morning till night.'<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
But he does not seem to have yet developed
his later passion for letter-writing, and the
'account of our situation and proceedings' is
still delegated to Gray, some of whose despatches
at this time are not preserved. There
is, however, one from Rheims to Gray's mother
which gives a vivid idea of the ancient French
Cathedral city, slumbering in its vast vine-clad
plain, with its picturesque old houses and lonely
streets, its long walks under the ramparts, and
its monotonous frog-haunted moat. They have
no want of society, for Henry Conway procured
them introductions everywhere; but the
Rhemois are more constrained, less familiar, less
hospitable, than the Parisians. Quadrille is the
almost invariable amusement, interrupted by one
entertainment (for the Rhemois as a rule give
neither dinners nor suppers); to wit, a five
o'clock <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">goûter</i>, which is 'a service of wine,
fruits, cream, sweetmeats, crawfish, and cheese,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>after which they sit down to cards again. Occasionally,
however, the demon of impromptu
flutters these 'set, gray lives,' and (like Dr.
Johnson) even Rheims must 'have a frisk.'
'For instance,' says Gray, 'the other evening
we happened to be got together in a company
of eighteen people, men and women of the best
fashion here, at a garden in the town, to walk;
when one of the ladies bethought herself of
asking, Why should we not sup here? Immediately
the cloth was laid by the side of a fountain
under the trees, and a very elegant supper
served up; after which another said, Come, let
us sing; and directly began herself. From
singing we insensibly fell to dancing, and singing
in a round; when somebody mentioned the
violins, and immediately a company of them was
ordered. Minuets were begun in the open air,
and then came country dances, which held till
four o'clock next morning; at which hour the
gayest lady there proposed that such as were
weary should get into their coaches, and the rest
of them should dance before them with the
music in the van; and in this manner we paraded
through all the principal streets of the city,
and waked everybody in it.' Walpole, adds Gray,
would have made this entertainment chronic.
But 'the women did not come into it,' and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
shrank back decorously 'to their dull cards, and
usual formalities.'<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>At Rheims the travellers lingered on in the
hope of being joined by Selwyn and George
Montagu. In September they left Rheims for
Dijon, the superior attractions of which town
made them rather regret their comparative rustication
of the last three months. From Dijon
they passed southward to Lyons, whence Gray
sent to West (then drinking the Tunbridge
waters) a daintily elaborated conceit touching
the junction of the Rhone and the Saône.
While at Lyons they made an excursion to
Geneva to escort Henry Conway, who had up
to this time been their companion, on his way
to that place. They took a roundabout route
in order to visit the Convent of the Grande
Chartreuse, and on the 28th Walpole writes to
West from 'a Hamlet among the mountains of
Savoy [Echelles].' He is to undergo many transmigrations,
he says, before he ends his letter.
'Yesterday I was a shepherd of Dauphiné;
to-day an Alpine savage; to-morrow a Carthusian
monk; and Friday a Swiss Calvinist.'
When he next takes up his pen, he has passed
through his third stage, and visited the Chartreuse.
With the convent itself neither Gray
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>nor his companions seem to have been much
impressed, probably because their expectations
had been indefinite. For the approach and the
situation they had only enthusiasm. Gray is the
accredited landscape-painter of the party, but
here even Walpole breaks out: 'The road,
West, the road! winding round a prodigious
mountain, and surrounded with others, all
shagged with hanging woods, obscured with
pines, or lost in clouds! Below, a torrent
breaking through cliffs, and tumbling through
fragments of rocks! Sheets of cascades forcing
their silver speed down channelled precipices,
and hastening into the roughened river at the
bottom! Now and then an old foot bridge,
with a broken rail, a leaning cross, a cottage, or
the ruin of an hermitage! This sounds too
bombast and too romantic to one that has not
seen it, too cold for one that has. If I could
send you my letter post between two lovely tempests
that echoed each other's wrath, you might
have some idea of this noble roaring scene, as
you were reading it. Almost on the summit,
upon a fine verdure, but without any prospect,
stands the Chartreuse.'<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The foregoing passage is dated Aix-in-Savoy,
30 September. Two days later, passing by
Annecy, they came to Geneva. Here they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>stayed a week to see Conway settled, and made
a 'solitary journey' back to Lyons, but by a
different road, through the spurs of the Jura
and across the plains of La Bresse. At Lyons
they found letters awaiting them from Sir Robert
Walpole, desiring his son to go to Italy,&mdash;a proposal
with which Gray, only too glad to exchange
the over-commercial city of Lyons for 'the
place in the world that best deserves seeing,'
was highly delighted. Accordingly, we speedily
find them duly equipped with 'beaver bonnets,
beaver gloves, beaver stockings, muffs, and
bear-skins' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for the Alps. At the foot
of Mont Cenis their chaise was taken to pieces
and loaded on mules, and they themselves were
transferred to low matted legless chairs carried
on poles,&mdash;a not unperilous mode of progression,
when, as in this case, quarrels took place
among the bearers. But the tragedy of the
journey happened before they had quitted the
chaise. Walpole had a fat little black spaniel
of King Charles's breed, named Tory, and he
had let the little creature out of the carriage for
the air. While it was waddling along contentedly
at the horses' heads, a gaunt wolf rushed
out of a fir wood, and exit poor Tory before
any one had time to snap a pistol. In later
years, Gray would perhaps have celebrated this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
mishap as elegantly as he sang the death of his
friend's favourite cat; but in these pre-poetic
days he restricts himself to calling it an 'odd
accident enough.'<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>'After eight days' journey through Greenland,'&mdash;as
Gray puts it to West,&mdash;they
reached Turin, where among other English
they found Pope's friend, Joseph Spence, Professor
of Poetry at Oxford. Beyond Walpole's
going to Court, and their visiting an extraordinary
play called <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Rappresentazione dell'
Anima Dannata</i> (for the benefit of an Hospital),
a full and particular account of which is contained
in one of Spence's letters to his mother,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
nothing remarkable seems to have happened
to them in the Piedmontese capital. From
Turin they went on to Genoa,&mdash;'the happy
country where huge lemons grow' (as Gray
quotes, not textually, from Waller),&mdash;whose
blue sea and vine-trellises they quit reluctantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>for Bologna, by way of Tortona, Piacenza,
Parma (where they inspect the Correggios in
the Duomo), Reggio, and Modena. At Bologna,
in the absence of introductions, picture-seeing
is their main occupation. 'Except
pictures and statues,' writes Walpole, 'we
are not very fond of sights.... Now and then
we drop in at a procession, or a high mass,
hear the music, enjoy a strange attire, and hate
the foul monkhood. Last week was the feast
of the Immaculate Conception. On the eve
we went to the Franciscans' church to hear the
academical exercises. There were moult and
moult clergy, about two dozen dames, that
treated one another with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">illustrissima</i> and brown
kisses, the vice-legate, the gonfalonier, and
some senate. The vice-legate ... is a young
personable person of about twenty, and had on
a mighty pretty cardinal-kind of habit; 'twou'd
make a delightful masquerade dress. We asked
his name: Spinola. What, a nephew of the
cardinal-legate? <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Signor, no; ma credo che gli
sia qualche cosa.</i> He sat on the right hand
with the gonfalonier in two purple fauteuils.
Opposite was a throne of crimson damask,
with the device of the Academy, the Gelati;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>and trimmings of gold. Here sat at a table,
in black, the head of the Academy, between
the orator and the first poet. At two semicircular
tables on either hand sat three poets and
three; silent among many candles. The chief
made a little introduction, the orator a long
Italian vile harangue. Then the chief, the poet,
the poets,&mdash;who were a Franciscan, an Olivetan,
an old abbé, and three lay,&mdash;read their
compositions; and to-day they are pasted up in
all parts of the town. As we came out of the
church, we found all the convent and neighbouring
houses lighted all over with lanthorns of red
and yellow paper, and two bonfires.'<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>In the Christmas of 1739, the friends crossed
the Apennines, and entered Florence. If they
had wanted introductions at Bologna, there was
no lack of them in Tuscany, and they were to
find one friend who afterwards figured largely
in Walpole's correspondence. This was Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>(afterwards Sir Horace) Mann, British Minister
Plenipotentiary at the Court of Florence. 'He
is the best and most obliging person in the
world,' says Gray, and his house, with a brief
interval, was their residence for fifteen months.
Their letters from Florence are less interesting
than those from which quotations have already
been made, while their amusements seem to
have been more independent of each other than
before. Gray occupied himself in the galleries
taking the notes of pictures and statuary afterwards
published by Mitford, and in forming a
collection of MS. music; Walpole, on the other
hand, had slightly cooled in his eagerness for
the antique, which now 'pleases him calmly.'
'I recollect'&mdash;he says&mdash;'the joy I used to
propose if I could but see the Great Duke's
gallery; I walk into it now with as little
emotion as I should into St. Paul's. The
statues are a congregation of good sort of
people that I have a great deal of unruffled
regard for.' The fact was, no doubt, that
society had now superior attractions. As the
son of the English Prime Minister, and with
Mann, who was a relation,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> at his elbow, all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>doors were open to him. A correct record of
his time would probably show an unvaried
succession of suppers, balls, and masquerades.
In the carnival week, when he snatches 'a little
unmasqued moment' to write to West, he says
he has done nothing lately 'but slip out of his
domino into bed, and out of bed into his
domino. The end of the Carnival is frantic,
bacchanalian; all the morn one makes parties
in masque to the shops and coffee-houses, and
all the evening to the operas and balls.' If
Gray was of these junketings, his letters do not
betray it. He was probably engaged in writing
uncomplimentary notes on the Venus de'
Medici, or transcribing a score of Pergolesi.</p>

<p>The first interruption to these diversions came
in March, when they quitted Florence for
Rome in order to witness the coronation of the
successor of Clement XII., who had died in
the preceding month. On their road from Siena
they were passed by a shrill-voiced figure in a
red cloak, with a white handkerchief on its head,
which they took for a fat old woman, but which
afterwards turned out to be Farinelli's rival,
Senesino. Rome disappointed them,&mdash;especially
in its inhabitants and general desolation.
'I am very glad,' writes Walpole, 'that I see
it while it yet exists;' and he goes on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
prophesy that before a great number of years it
will cease to exist. 'I am persuaded,' he says
again, 'that in an hundred years Rome will not
be worth seeing; 'tis less so now than one
would believe. All the public pictures are
decayed or decaying; the few ruins cannot last
long; and the statues and private collections
must be sold, from the great poverty of
the families.' Perhaps this last consideration,
coupled with the depressing character of Roman
hospitality ('Roman conversations are dreadful
things!' he tells Conway), revived his
virtuoso tastes. 'I am far gone in medals,
lamps, idols, prints, etc., and all the small commodities
to the purchase of which I can attain;
I would buy the Coliseum if I could.' Meanwhile
as the cardinals are quarrelling, the
coronation is still deferred; and they visit
Naples, whence they explore Herculaneum,
then but recently exposed and identified. But
neither Gray nor Walpole waxes very eloquent
upon this theme,&mdash;probably because at this
time the excavations were only partial, while
Pompeii was, of course, as yet under ground.
Walpole's next letter is written from Radicofani,&mdash;'a
vile little town at the foot of an old
citadel,' which again is at 'the top of a black
barren mountain;' the whole reminding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
writer of 'Hamilton's Bawn' in Swift's verses.
In this place, although the traditional residence
of one of the Three Kings of Cologne, there
is but one pen, the property of the Governor,
who when Walpole borrows it, sends it to him
under 'conduct of a sergeant and two Swiss,'
with special injunctions as to its restoration,&mdash;a
precaution which in Walpole's view renders
it worthy to be ranked with the other precious
relics of the poor Capuchins of the place,
concerning which he presently makes rather
unkindly fun. A few days later they were
once more in the Casa Ambrosio, Mann's
pleasant house at Florence, with the river
running so close to them that they could fish
out of the windows. 'I have a terreno [ground-floor]
all to myself,' says Walpole, 'with an
open gallery on the Arno, where I am now
writing to you [<i>i. e.</i>, Conway]. Over against
me is the famous Gallery; and, on either hand,
two fair bridges. Is not this charming and
cool?' Add to which, on the bridges aforesaid,
in the serene Italian air, one may linger all night
in a dressing-gown, eating iced fruits to the
notes of a guitar. But (what was even better
than music and moonlight) there is the society
that was the writer's 'fitting environment.' Lady
Pomfret, with her daughters, Lady Charlotte,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
afterwards governess to the children of George
III., and the beauty Lady Sophia, held a
'charming conversation' once a week; while
the Princess Craon de Beauvau has 'a constant
pharaoh and supper every night, where one is
quite at one's ease.' Another lady-resident,
scarcely so congenial to Walpole, was his
sister-in-law, the wife of his eldest brother,
Robert, who, with Lady Pomfret, made certain
(in Walpole's eyes) wholly preposterous pretentions
to the yet uninvented status of
blue-stocking. To Lady Walpole and Lady
Pomfret was speedily added another 'she-meteor'
in the person of the celebrated Lady
Mary Wortley Montagu.</p>

<p>When Lady Mary arrived in Florence in the
summer of 1740, she was a woman of more
than fifty, and was just entering upon that
unexplained exile from her country and husband
which was prolonged for two-and-twenty
years. Her brilliant abilities were unimpaired;
but it is probable that the personal eccentricities
which had exposed her to the satire
of Pope, had not decreased with years. That
these would be extenuated under Walpole's
malicious pen was not to be expected; still
less, perhaps, that they would be treated justly.
Although, as already intimated, he was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
aware of the scandal respecting himself which
her descendants were to revive, he had ample
ground for antipathy. Her husband was the
bitter foe of Sir Robert Walpole; and she
herself had been the firm friend and protectress
of his mother's rival and successor, Miss
Skerret.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Accordingly, even before her advent,
he makes merry over the anticipated issue of
this portentous 'triple alliance' of mysticism
and nonsense, and later he writes to Conway:
'Did I tell you Lady Mary Wortley is here?
She laughs at my Lady Walpole, scolds my
Lady Pomfret, and is laughed at by the whole
town. Her dress, her avarice, and her impudence
must amaze any one that never heard her
name. She wears a foul mob, that does not
cover her greasy black locks, that hang loose,
never combed or curled; an old mazarine blue
wrapper, that gaps open and discovers a canvas
petticoat.... In three words, I will give you
her picture as we drew it in the <cite>Sortes Virgilianæ</cite>,&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Insanam
vatem aspicies</i>. I give you
my honour we did not choose it; but Gray,
Mr. Coke, Sir Francis Dashwood, and I, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>several others, drew it fairly amongst a thousand
for different people.'<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> In justice to Lady Mary
it is only fair to say that she seems to have
been quite unconscious that she was an object
of ridicule, and was perfectly satisfied with her
reception at Florence. 'Lord and Lady Pomfret'&mdash;she
tells Mr. Wortley&mdash;'take pains
to make the place agreeable to me, and I have
been visited by the greatest part of the people
of quality.'<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> But although Walpole's portrait
is obviously malicious (some of its details are
suppressed in the above quotation), it is plain
that even unprejudiced spectators could not
deny her peculiarities. 'Lady Mary,' said
Spence, 'is one of the most shining characters
in the world, but shines like a comet; she
is all irregularity, and always wandering; the
most wise, the most imprudent; loveliest, most
disagreeable; best-natured, cruellest woman in
the world: "all things by turns, but nothing
long."'<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>By this time the new pope, Benedict XIV.,
had been elected. But although the friends
were within four days journey of Rome, the
fear of heat and malaria forced them to forego
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>the spectacle of the coronation. They continued
to reside with Mann at Florence until
May in the following year. Upon Gray the
'violent delights' of the Tuscan capital had
already begun to pall. It is, he says, 'an
excellent place to employ all one's animal
sensations in, but utterly contrary to one's
rational powers.' Walpole, on the other hand,
is in his element. 'I am so well within and
without,' he says in the same letter which
sketches Lady Mary, 'that you would scarce
know me: I am younger than ever, think of
nothing but diverting myself, and live in a round
of pleasures. We have operas, concerts, and
balls, mornings and evenings. I dare not tell
you all of one's idlenesses; you would look so
grave and senatorial at hearing that one rises at
eleven in the morning, goes to the opera at nine
at night, to supper at one, and to bed at three!
But literally here the evenings and nights are so
charming and so warm, one can't avoid 'em.'
In a later letter he says he has lost all curiosity,
and 'except the towns in the straight road to
Great Britain, shall scarce see a jot more of a
foreign land.' Indeed, save a sally concerning
the humours of 'Moll Worthless' (Lady Mary)
and Lady Walpole, and the record of the purchase
of a few pictures, medals, and busts,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>one
of the last of which, a Vespasian in basalt,
was subsequently among the glories of the
Twickenham Gallery,&mdash;his remaining letters
from Florence contain little of interest. Early
in 1741, the homeward journey was mapped out.
They were to go to Bologna to hear the
Viscontina sing, they were to visit the Fair
at Reggio, and so by Venice homewards.</p>

<p>But whether the Viscontina was in voice or
not, there is, as far as our travellers are concerned,
absence of evidence. No further letter
of Gray from Florence has been preserved, nor
is there any mention of him in Walpole's next
despatch to West from Reggio. At that place
a misunderstanding seems to have arisen, and
they parted, Gray going forward to Venice with
two other travelling companions, Mr. John
Chute and Mr. Whitehed. In the rather barren
record of Walpole's story, this misunderstanding
naturally assumes an exaggerated importance.
But it was really a very trifling and a very intelligible
affair. They had been too long together;
and the first fascination of travel, which formed
at the outset so close a bond, had gradually
faded with time. As this alteration took place,
their natural dispositions began to assert themselves,
and Walpole's normal love of pleasure
and Gray's retired studiousness became more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and more apparent. It is probable too, that,
in all the Florentine gaieties, Gray, who was
not a great man's son, fell a little into the
background. At all events, the separation was
imminent, and it needed but a nothing&mdash;the
alleged opening by Walpole of a letter of Gray<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>&mdash;to
to bring it about. Whatever the proximate
cause, both were silent on the subject, although,
years after the quarrel had been made up, and
Gray was dead, Walpole took the entire blame
upon himself. When Mason was preparing
Gray's <cite>Memoirs</cite> in 1773, he authorized him to
insert a note by which, in general terms, he
admitted himself to have been in fault, assigning
as his reason for not being more explicit,
that while he was living it would not be pleasant
to read his private affairs discussed in magazines
and newspapers. But to Mason personally he
was at the same time thoroughly candid, as well
as considerate to his departed friend: 'I am
conscious,' he says, 'that in the beginning of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>the differences between Gray and me, the fault
was mine. I was too young, too fond of my
own diversions, nay, I do not doubt, too much
intoxicated by indulgence, vanity, and the
insolence of my situation, as a Prime Minister's
son, not to have been inattentive and
insensible to the feelings of one I thought
below me; of one, I blush to say it, that I
knew was obliged to me; of one whom presumption
and folly perhaps made me deem not
my superior <em>then</em> in parts, though I have since
felt my infinite inferiority to him. I treated
him insolently: he loved me, and I did not think
he did. I reproached him with the difference
between us when he acted from conviction of
knowing he was my superior; I often disregarded
his wishes of seeing places, which I
would not quit other amusements to visit,
though I offered to send him to them without
me. Forgive me, if I say that his temper was
not conciliating. At the same time that I will
confess to you that he acted a more friendly
part, had I had the sense to take advantage of
it; he freely told me of my faults. I declared
I did not desire to hear them, nor would correct
them. You will not wonder that with the
dignity of his spirit, and the obstinate care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>lessness
of mine, the breach must have grown
wider till we became incompatible.'<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>'Sir, you have said more than was necessary'
was Johnson's reply to a peace-making speech
from Topham Beauclerk. It is needless to
comment further upon this incident, except to
add that Walpole's generous words show that
the disagreement was rather the outcome of a
sequence of long-strained circumstances than
the result of momentary petulance. For a time
reconciliation was deferred, but eventually it
was effected by a lady, and the intimacy thus
renewed continued for the remainder of Gray's
life.</p>

<p>Shortly after Gray's departure in May, Walpole
fell ill of a quinsy. He did not, at first,
recognise the gravity of his ailment, and doctored
himself. By a fortunate chance, Joseph
Spence, then travelling as governor to the Earl
of Lincoln, was in the neighbourhood, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>responding to a message from Walpole, 'found
him scarce able to speak.' Spence immediately
sent for medical aid, and summoned from Florence
one Antonio Cocchi, a physician and author
of some eminence. Under Cocchi's advice,
Walpole speedily showed signs of improvement,
though, in his own words in the <cite>Short Notes</cite>,
he 'was given over for five hours, escaping with
great difficulty.' The sequel may be told from
the same source. 'I went to Venice with Henry
Clinton, Earl of Lincoln, and Mr. Joseph
Spence, Professor of Poetry, and after a
month's stay there, returned with them by sea
from Genoa, landing at Antibes; and by the
way of Toulon, Marseilles, Aix, and through
Languedoc to Montpellier, Toulouse, and
Orléans, arrived at Paris, where I left the
Earl and Mr. Spence, and landed at Dover,
September 12th, 1741, O. S., having been
chosen Member of Parliament for Kellington
[Callington], in Cornwall, at the preceding
General Election [of June], which Parliament
put a period to my father's administration,
which had continued above twenty years.'</p>

<p>Although, during his stay in Italy,
Walpole had neglected to accumulate the
store of erudition which his friend Gray had
been so industriously hiving for home consumption,
he can scarcely be said to have learned
nothing, especially at an age when much is
learned unconsciously. His epistolary style,
which, with its peculiar graces and pseudo-graces,
had been already formed before he left
England, had now acquired a fresh vivacity
from his increased familiarity with the French
and Italian languages; and he had carried on,
however discursively, something more than a
mere flirtation with antiquities. Dr. Conyers
Middleton, whose once famous <cite>Life of Cicero</cite>
was published early in 1741, and who was him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>self
an antiquary of distinction, thought highly
of Walpole's attainments in this way,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and indeed
more than one passage in a poem written
by Walpole to Ashton at this time could scarcely
have been penned by any one not fairly familiar
with (for example) the science of those 'medals'
upon which Mr. Joseph Addison had discoursed
so learnedly after his Italian tour:&mdash;</p>

to some four hundred lines, and exhibits
another side of Walpole's activity in Italy.
'You have seen'&mdash;says Gray to West in July,
1740&mdash;'an Epistle to Mr. Ashton, that seems
to me full of spirit and thought, and a good
deal of poetic fire.' Writing to him ten years
later, Gray seems still to have retained his first
impression. 'Satire'&mdash;he says&mdash;'will be
heard, for all the audience are by nature her
friends; especially when she appears in the
spirit of Dryden, with his strength, and often
with his versification, such as you have caught in
those lines on the Royal Unction, on the Papal
dominion, and Convents of both Sexes; on
Henry VIII. and Charles II., for these are to

<p>That the refined and fastidious Horace Walpole
of later years should have begun as a passable
imitator of Dryden is sufficiently piquant. But
that the son of the great courtier Prime Minister
should have distinguished himself by the
vigour of his denunciations of kings and priests,
especially when, as his biographers have not
failed to remark, he was writing to one about
to take orders, is more noticeable still. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>poem was reprinted in his works, but he makes
no mention of it in the <cite>Short Notes</cite>, nor of an
<cite>Inscription for the Neglected Column in the Place
of St. Mark at Florence</cite>, written at the same
time, and characterized by the same anti-monarchical
spirit.</p>

<p>His letters to Mann, his chief correspondent
at this date, are greatly occupied, during the
next few months, with the climax of the catastrophe
recorded at the end of the preceding
chapter,&mdash;the resignation of Sir Robert Walpole.
The first of the long series was written on his
way home in September, 1741, when he had for
his fellow-passengers the Viscontina, Amorevoli,
and other Italian singers, then engaged in invading
England. He appears to have at once taken
up his residence with his father in Downing
Street. Into the network of circumstances which
had conspired to array against the great peace
Minister the formidable opposition of disaffected
Whigs, Jacobites, Tories, and adherents of the
Prince of Wales, it would here be impossible
to enter. But there were already signs that
Sir Robert was nodding to his fall; and that,
although the old courage was as high as ever,
the old buoyancy was beginning to flag. Failing
health added its weight to the scale. In
October Walpole tells his correspondent that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
he had 'been very near sealing his letter with
black wax,' for his father had been in danger
of his life, but was recovering, though he is no
longer the Sir Robert that Mann once knew.
He who formerly would snore before they had
drawn his curtains, now never slept above an
hour without waking; and 'he who at dinner
always forgot that he was Minister,' now sat
silent, with eyes fixed for an hour together. At
the opening of Parliament, however, there was
an ostensible majority of forty for the Court,
and Walpole seems to have regarded this as
encouraging. But one of the first motions was
for an inquiry into the state of the nation, and
this was followed by a division upon a Cornish
petition which reduced the majority to seven,&mdash;a
variation which sets the writer nervously jesting
about apartments in the Tower. Seven days
later, the opposition obtained a majority of four;
and although Sir Robert, still sanguine in the
remembrance of past successes, seemed less
anxious than his family, matters were growing
grave, and his youngest son was reconciling
himself to the coming blow. It came practically
on the 21st January, 1742, when Pulteney
moved for a secret committee, which (in reality)
was to be a committee of accusation against
the Prime Minister. Walpole defeated this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
manœuvre with his characteristic courage and
address, but only by a narrow majority of three.
So inconsiderable a victory upon so crucial a
question was perilously close to a reverse; and
when, in the succeeding case of the disputed
Chippenham Election, the Government were
defeated by one, he yielded to the counsels of
his advisers, and decided to resign. He was
thereupon raised to the peerage as Earl of
Orford, with a pension of £4,000 a year,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> while
his daughter by his second wife, Miss Skerret,
was created an Earl's daughter in her own
right. His fall was mourned by no one more
sincerely than by the master he had served so
staunchly for so long; and when he went to
kiss hands at St. James's upon taking leave,
the old king fell upon his neck, embraced him,
and broke into tears.</p>

<p>The new Earl himself seems to have taken
his reverses with his customary equanimity, and,
like the shrewd 'old Parliamentary hand' that
he was, to have at once devoted himself to the
difficult task of breaking the force of the attack
which he foresaw would be made upon himself
by those in power. He contrived adroitly to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>foster dissension and disunion among the heterogeneous
body of his opponents; he secured
that the new Ministry should be mainly composed
of his old party, the Whigs; and he
managed to discredit his most formidable adversary,
Pulteney. One of the first results of
these precautionary measures was that a motion
by Lord Limerick for a committee to examine
into the conduct of the last twenty years was
thrown out by a small majority. A fortnight
later the motion was renewed in a fresh form,
the scope of the examination being limited to
the last ten years. Upon this occasion Horace
Walpole made his maiden speech,&mdash;a graceful
and modest, if not very forcible, effort on his
father's side. In this instance, however, the
Government were successful, and the Committee
was appointed. Yet, despite the efforts to
excite the public mind respecting Lord Orford,
the case against him seems to have faded away
in the hands of his accusers. The first report
of the Committee, issued in May, contained
nothing to criminate the person against whom
the inquiry had been directly levelled; and
despite the strenuous and even shameless efforts
of the Government to obtain evidence inculpating
the late Minister, the Committee were
obliged to issue a second report in June, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
which,&mdash;so far as the chief object was concerned,&mdash;the
gross result was nil. By the
middle of July, Walpole was able to tell Mann
that the 'long session was over, and the Secret
Committee already forgotten,'&mdash;as much forgotten,
he says in a later letter, 'as if it had
happened in the last reign.'</p>

<p>When Sir Robert Walpole had resigned, he
had quitted his official residence in Downing
Street (which ever since he first occupied it in
1735 has been the official residence of the First
Lord of the Treasury), and moved to No. 5,
Arlington Street, opposite to, but smaller than,
the No. 17 in which his youngest son had been
born, and upon the site of which William Kent
built a larger house for Mr. Pelham. No. 5 is
now distinguished by a tablet erected by the
Society of Arts, proclaiming it to have been the
house of the ex-Minister. From Arlington
Street, or from the other home at Chelsea
already mentioned, most of Walpole's letters
were dated during the months which succeeded
the crisis. But in August, when the House had
risen, he migrated with the rest of the family
to Houghton,&mdash;the great mansion in Norfolk
which had now taken the place of the ancient
seat of the Walpoles, where during the summer
months his father had been accustomed in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
free-handed manner to keep open house to all
the county. Fond of hospitality, fond of field-sports,
fond of gardening, and all out-door
occupations, Lord Orford was at home among
the flat expanses and Norfolk turnips. But the
family seat had no such attractions to his son,
fresh from the multi-coloured Continental life,
and still bearing about him, in a certain frailty
of physique and enervation of spirit, the tokens
of a sickly childhood. 'Next post'&mdash;he says despairingly
to Mann&mdash;'I shall not be able to write
to you; and when I am there [at Houghton],
shall scarce find materials to furnish a letter
above every other post. I beg, however, that
you will write constantly to me; it will be my
only entertainment; for I neither hunt, brew,
drink, nor reap.' 'Consider'&mdash;he says again&mdash;'I
am in the barren land of Norfolk, where
news grows as slow as anything green; and
besides, I am in the house of a fallen minister!'
Writing letters (in company with the little white
dog 'Patapan'<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> which he had brought from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>Rome as a successor to the defunct Tory),
walking, and playing comet with his sister Lady
Mary or any chance visitors to the house, seem
to have been his chief resources. A year later
he pays a second visit to Houghton, and he is
still unreconciled to his environment. 'Only
imagine that I here every day see men, who are
mountains of roast beef, and only just seem
roughly hewn out into the outlines of human
form, like the giant-rock at Pratolino! I shudder
when I see them brandish their knives in
act to carve, and look on them as savages that
devour one another.' Then there are the enforced
civilities to entirely uninteresting people,&mdash;the
intolerable female relative, who is curious about
her cousins to the fortieth remove. 'I have an
Aunt here, a family piece of goods, an old remnant
of inquisitive hospitality and economy,
who, to all intents and purposes, is as beefy as
her neighbours. She wore me so down yesterday
with interrogatories that I dreamt all
night she was at my ear with "who's" and
"why's," and "when's" and "where's," till at
last in my very sleep I cried out, "For heaven's
sake, Madam, ask me no more questions."' And
then, in his impatience of bores in general, he
goes on to write a little essay upon that 'growth
of English root,' that 'awful yawn, which sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
cannot abate,' as Byron calls it,&mdash;Ennui. 'I am
so far from growing used to mankind [he means
'uncongenial mankind'] by living amongst them,
that my natural ferocity and wildness does but
every day grow worse. They tire me, they
fatigue me; I don't know what to do with them;
I don't know what to say to them; I fling open
the windows, and fancy I want air; and when I
get by myself, I undress myself, and seem to
have had people in my pockets, in my plaits,
and on my shoulders! I indeed find this fatigue
worse in the country than in town, because one
can avoid it there, and has more resources; but
it is there too. I fear 'tis growing old; but I
literally seem to have murdered a man whose
name was Ennui, for his ghost is ever before
me. They say there is no English word for
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i>; I think you may translate it most literally
by what is called "entertaining people" and
"doing the honours:" that is, you sit an hour
with somebody you don't know and don't care
for, talk about the wind and the weather, and
ask a thousand foolish questions, which all begin
with, "I think you live a good deal in the country,"
or "I think you don't love this thing or
that." Oh, 'tis dreadful!'<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>But even Houghton, with its endless 'doing
the honours,' must have had its compensations.
There was a library, and&mdash;what must have had
even stronger attractions for Horace Walpole&mdash;that
magnificent and almost unique collection
of pictures which under a later member of the
family, the third Earl of Orford, passed to
Catherine of Russia. For years Lord Orford,
with unwearied diligence and exceptional opportunities,
had been accumulating these treasures.
Mann in Florence, Vertue in England, and a
host of industrious foragers had helped to bring
together the priceless canvases which crowded
the rooms of the Minister's house next the
Treasury at Whitehall. And if he was inexperienced
as a critic, he was far too acute a man
to be deceived by the shiploads of 'Holy
Families, Madonnas, and other dismal dark
subjects, neither entertaining nor ornamental,'
against which the one great native artist of his
time,&mdash;the painter of the 'Rake's Progress,' so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>persistently inveighed. There was no doubt
about the pedigrees of the Wouvermanns and
Teniers, the Guidos and Rubens, the Vandykes
and Murillos, which decorated the rooms at
Downing Street and Chelsea and Richmond.
From the few records which remain of prices,
it would seem that, in addition to the merit of
authenticity, many of the pictures must have had
the attraction of being 'bargains.' In days
when £4,000 or £5,000 is no extravagant price
to be given for an old master, it is instructive to
read that £750 was the largest sum ever given
by Lord Orford for any one picture, and Walpole
himself quotes this amount as £630. For four
great Snyders, which Vertue bought for him, he
only paid £428, and for a portrait of Clement
IX. by Carlo Maratti no more than £200.
Many of the other pictures in his gallery cost
him still less, being donations&mdash;no doubt sometimes
in gratitude for favours to come&mdash;from
his friends and adherents. The Earl of Pembroke,
Lord Waldegrave, the Duke of Montagu,
Lord Tyrawley, were among these. But,
upon the whole, the collection was gathered
mainly from galleries like the Zambecari at
Bologna, the Arnaldi Palace at Florence, the
Pallavicini at Rome, and from the stores of
noble collectors in England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1743, the majority of these had apparently
been concentrated at Houghton, where there
was special accommodation for them. 'My
Lord,' says Horace, groaning over a fresh visit
to Norfolk, 'has pressed me so much that I
could not with decency refuse: he is going to
furnish and hang his picture-gallery, and wants
me.' But it is impossible to believe that he
really objected to a duty so congenial to his
tastes. In fact, he was really greatly interested
in it. His letters contain frequent references
to a new Domenichino, a Virgin and Child,
which Mann is sending from Florence, and he
comes up to London to meet this and other
pictures, and is not seriously inconsolable to
find that owing to the quarantine for the plague
on the Continent, he is detained for some days
in town. One of the best evidences of his
solicitude in connection with the arrangements
of the Houghton collection is, however, the
discourse which he wrote in the summer of
1742, under the title of a <cite>Sermon on Painting</cite>,
and which he himself tells us was actually
preached by the Earl's chaplain in the gallery,
and afterwards repeated at Stanno, his elder
brother's house. The text was taken from
Psalm CXV.: 'They have Mouths, but they
speak not: Eyes have they, but they see not:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
neither is there any Breath in their Nostrils;' and
the writer, illustrating his theme by reference to
the pictures around his audience in the gallery,
or dispersed through the building, manages to
eulogize the painter's art with considerable skill.
He touches upon the pernicious effect which
the closely realized representation of popish
miracles must have upon the illiterate spectator,
and points out how much more commendable
and serviceable is the portraiture of benignity,
piety, and chastity,&mdash;how much more instructive
the incidents of the Passion, where every
'touch of the pencil is a lesson of contrition,
each figure an apostle to call you to repentance.'
He lays stress, as Lessing and other writers
have done, on the universal language of the
brush, and indicates its abuse when restricted
to the reproduction of inquisitors, visionaries,
imaginary hermits, 'consecrated gluttons,' or
'noted concubines,' after which (as becomes
his father's son) he does not fail to disclose its
more fitting vocation, to perpetuate the likeness
of William the Deliverer, and the benign, the
honest house of Hanover. <cite>The Dives and Lazarus</cite>
of Veronese and the <cite>Prodigal Son</cite> of
Salvator Rosa, both on the walls, are pressed
into his service, and the famous <cite>Usurers</cite> of
Quentin Matsys also prompt their parable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Then, after adroitly dwelling upon the pictorial
honours lavished upon mere asceticism to the
prejudice of real heroes, taking Poussin's picture
of <cite>Moses Striking the Rock</cite> for his text, he
winds into what was probably the ultimate purpose
of his discourse, a neatly veiled panegyric
of Sir Robert Walpole under guise of the great
lawgiver of the Israelites, which may be cited as
a favourable sample of this curious oration:</p>

<p>'But it is not necessary to dive into profane
history for examples of unregarded merit; the
Scriptures themselves contain instances of the
greatest patriots, who lie neglected, while new-fashioned
bigots or noisy incendiaries are the
reigning objects of public veneration. See the
great Moses himself,&mdash;the lawgiver, the defender,
the preserver of Israel! Peevish orators
are more run after, and artful Jesuits more popular.
Examine but the life of that slighted patriot,
how boldly in his youth he understood the
cause of liberty! Unknown, without interest,
he stood against the face of Pharaoh! He
saved his countrymen from the hand of tyranny,
and from the dominion of an idolatrous king.
How patiently did he bear for a series of years
the clamours and cabals of a factious people,
wandering after strange lusts, and exasperated
by ambitious ringleaders! How oft did he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
intercede for their pardon, when injured himself!
How tenderly deny them specious favours,
which he knew must turn to their own destruction!
See him lead them through opposition,
through plots, through enemies, to the enjoyment
of peace, and to the possession of <em>a land
flowing with milk and honey</em>. Or with more
surprise see him in the barren desert, where
sands and wilds overspread the dreary scene,
where no hopes of moisture, no prospect of
undiscovered springs, could flatter their parching
thirst; see how with a miraculous hand&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">'"He struck the rock, and straight the waters flowed."'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Whoever denies his praises to such evidences
of merit, or with jealous look can scowl on such
benefits, is like the senseless idol, that <em>has a
mouth that speaks not, and eyes that cannot
see</em>.'</p>

<p>If, in accordance with some perverse fashion
of the day, the foregoing production had not
been disguised as a sermon, and actually preached
with the orthodox accompaniment of bands and
doxology, there is no reason why it should not
have been regarded as a harmless and not unaccomplished
essay on Art. But the objectionable
spirit of parody upon the ritual, engendered by
the strife between 'high' and 'low' (Walpole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
himself wrote some <cite>Lessons for the Day</cite>, 1742,
which are to be found in the works of Sir
Charles Hanbury Williams), seems to have dictated
the title of what in other respects is a
serious <cite>Spectator</cite>, and needed no spice of irreverence
to render it palatable. The <cite>Sermon</cite> had,
however, one valuable result, namely, that it
suggested to its author the expediency of preparing
some record of the pictorial riches of
Houghton upon the model of the famous <cite>Ædes
Barberini</cite> and <cite>Giustinianæ</cite>. As the dedication
of the <cite>Ædes Walpolianæ</cite> is dated 24 August,
1743, it must have been written before that date;
but it was not actually published until 1747, and
then only to give away. Another enlarged and
more accurate edition was issued in 1752, and it
was finally reprinted in the second volume of the
<cite>Works</cite> of 1798, pp. 221-78, where it is followed
by the <cite>Sermon on Painting</cite>. Professing to be
more a catalogue of the pictures than a description
of them, it nevertheless gives a good idea
of a collection which (as its historian says) both
in its extent and the condition of its treasures
excelled most of the existing collections of Italy.
In an 'Introduction,' the characteristics of the
various artists are distinguished with much
discrimination, although it is naturally more
sympathetic than critical. Perhaps one of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
happiest pages is the following excursus upon
a poem of Prior: 'I cannot conclude this topic
of the ancient painters without taking notice of
an extreme pretty instance of Prior's taste, and
which may make an example on that frequent
subject, the resemblance between poetry and
painting, and prove that taste in the one will
influence in the other. Everybody has read his
tale of Protogenes and Apelles. If they have
read the story in Pliny they will recollect that
by the latter's account it seemed to have been
a trial between two Dutch performers. The
Roman author tells you that when Apelles was
to write his name on a board, to let Protogenes
know who had been to inquire for him, he drew
an exactly straight and slender line. Protogenes
returned, and with his pencil and another colour,
divided his competitor's. Apelles, on seeing
the ingenious minuteness of the Rhodian master,
took a third colour, and laid on a still finer and
indivisible line. But the English poet, who
could distinguish the emulation of genius from
nice experiments about splitting hairs, took the
story into his own hands, and in a less number
of trials, and with bolder execution, comprehended
the whole force of painting, and flung
drawing, colouring, and the doctrine of light
and shade into the noble contention of those two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
absolute masters. In Prior, the first wrote his
name in a perfect design, and</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">'"&mdash;&mdash;with one judicious stroke</div>
    <div class="verse">On the plain ground Apelles drew</div>
    <div class="verse">A circle regularly true."'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Protogenes knew the hand, and showed Apelles
that his own knowledge of colouring was as
great as the other's skill in drawing.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">'"Upon the happy line he laid</div>
    <div class="verse">Such obvious light and easy shade</div>
    <div class="verse">That Paris' apple stood confest,</div>
    <div class="verse">Or Leda's egg, or Chloe's breast."'<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Apelles acknowledged his rival's merit, without
jealously persisting to refine on the masterly
reply:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">'"Pugnavere pares, succubuere pares"'<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Among the other efforts of his pen at this
time were some squibs in ridicule of the new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>Ministry. One was a parody of a scene in
<cite>Macbeth</cite>; the other of a scene in Corneille's
<cite>Cinna</cite>. He also wrote a paper against Lord
Bath in the <cite>Old England Journal</cite>.</p>

<p>In the not very perplexed web of Horace
Walpole's life, the next occurrence of importance
is his father's death. When, as Sir Robert
Walpole, he had ceased to be Prime Minister,
he was sixty-five years of age; and though
his equanimity and wonderful constitution still
seemed to befriend him, he had personally little
desire, even if the ways had been open, to
recover his ancient power. 'I believe nothing
could prevail on him to return to the Treasury,'
writes his son to Mann in 1743. 'He says
he will keep the 12th of February&mdash;the day
he resigned&mdash;with his family as long as he
lives.' He continued nevertheless, to assist
his old master with his counsel, and more than
one step of importance by which the King
startled his new Ministry owed its origin to
a confidential consultation with Lord Orford.
When, in January, 1744, the old question of
discontinuing the Hanoverian troops was revived
with more than ordinary insistence, it was
through Lord Orford's timely exertions, and his
personal credit with his friends, that the motion
was defeated by an overwhelming majority. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the other hand, a further attempt to harass him
by another Committee of Secret Inquiry was
wholly unsuccessful, and signs were not wanting
that his old prestige had by no means departed.
Towards the close of 1744, however, his son
begins to chronicle a definite decline in his
health. He is evidently suffering seriously from
stone, and is forbidden to take the least exercise
by the King's serjeant-surgeon, that famous
Mr. Ranby who was the friend of Hogarth and
Fielding.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> In January of the next year, he is
trying a famous specific for his complaint, Mrs.
Stephens's medicine. Six weeks later, he has
been alarmingly ill for about a month; and
although reckoned out of absolute danger, is
hardly ever conscious more than four hours out
of the four-and-twenty, from the powerful opiates
he takes in order to deaden pain. A month later,
on the 18th March, 1745, he died at Arlington
Street, in his sixty-ninth year. At first his son
dares scarcely speak of his loss, but a fortnight
afterwards he writes more fully. After showing
that the state of his circumstances proved how
little truth there had been in the charges of self-enrichment
made against him, Walpole goes on
to say: 'It is certain, he is dead very poor:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>his debts, with his legacies, which are trifling,
amount to fifty thousand pounds. His estate,
a nominal eight thousand a year, much mortgaged.
In short, his fondness for Houghton has
endangered him. If he had not so overdone it,
he might have left such an estate to his family as
might have secured the glory of the place for
many years: another such debt must expose it to
sale. If he had lived, his unbounded generosity
and contempt of money would have run him into
vast difficulties. However irreparable his personal
loss may be to his friends, he certainly died
critically well for himself: he had lived to stand
the rudest trials with honour, to see his character
universally cleared, his enemies brought to
infamy for their ignorance or villainy, and the
world allowing him to be the only man in
England fit to be what he had been; and he
died at a time when his age and infirmities
prevented his again undertaking the support of
a government, which engrossed his whole care,
and which he foresaw was falling into the last
confusion. In this I hope his judgment failed!
His fortune attended him to the last, for he died
of the most painful of all distempers, with little
or no pain.'<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>From the <cite>Short Notes</cite> we learn further:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>'He [my father] left me the house in Arlington-street

<p>During the period between Walpole's
return to England and the death of Lord
Orford, his letters, addressed almost exclusively
to Mann, are largely occupied with the occurrences
which accompanied and succeeded his
father's downfall. To Lord Orford's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</i>
and relative these particulars were naturally of
the first importance, and Walpole's function of
'General Intelligencer' fell proportionately into
the background. Still, there are occasional references
to current events of a merely social
character. After the Secret Committee, he is
interested (probably because his friend Conway
was pecuniarily interested) in the Opera, and
the reception by the British public of the
Viscontina, Amorevoli, and the other Italian
singers whom he had known abroad. Of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
stage he says comparatively little, dismissing
poor Mrs. Woffington, who had then just made
her appearance at Covent Garden, as 'a bad
actress,' who, nevertheless, 'has life,'&mdash;an
opinion in which he is supported by Conway,
who calls her 'an impudent, Irish-faced girl.'
In the acting of Garrick, after whom all the
town is (as Gray writes) 'horn-mad' in May,
1742, he sees nothing wonderful, although he
admits that it is heresy to say so, since that
infallible stage critic, the Duke of Argyll, has
declared him superior to Betterton. But he
praises 'a little simple farce' at Drury Lane,
<cite>Miss Lucy in Town</cite>, by Henry Fielding, in
which his future friend, Mrs. Clive, and Beard
mimic Amorevoli and the Muscovita. The
same letter contains a reference to another
famous stage-queen, now nearing eighty, Anne
Bracegirdle, who should have had the money
that Congreve left to Henrietta, Duchess of
Marlborough. 'Tell Mr. Chute [he says] that
his friend Bracegirdle breakfasted with me this
morning. As she went out, and wanted her
clogs, she turned to me, and said, "I remember
at the playhouse, they used to call, Mrs.
Oldfield's chair! Mrs. Barry's clogs! and
Mrs. Bracegirdle's pattens!"'<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> One pictures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>a handsome old lady, a little bent, and leaning
on a crutch stick as she delivers this parting
utterance at the door.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Among the occurrences of 1742 which find
fitting record in the correspondence, is the
opening of that formidable rival to Vauxhall,
Ranelagh Gardens. All through the spring the
great Rotunda, with its encircling tiers of galleries
and supper-boxes,&mdash;the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d'œil</i> of which
Johnson thought was the finest thing he had
ever seen,&mdash;had been rising slowly at the side
of Chelsea Hospital. In April it was practically
completed, and almost ready for visitors.
Walpole, of course, breakfasts there, like the
rest of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau monde</i>. 'The building is not
finished [he says], but they get great sums by
people going to see it and breakfasting in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>house; there were yesterday no less than three
hundred and eighty persons, at eighteenpence
a-piece. You see how poor we are, when, with
a tax of four shillings in the pound, we are laying
out such sums for cakes and ale.'<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> A week
or two later comes the formal inauguration.
'Two nights ago [May 24] Ranelagh-gardens
were opened at Chelsea; the Prince, Princess,
Duke, much nobility, and much mob besides,
were there. There is a vast amphitheatre, finely
gilt, painted, and illuminated, into which everybody
that loves eating, drinking, staring, or
crowding, is admitted for twelvepence. The
building and disposition of the gardens cost
sixteen thousand pounds. Twice a week there
are to be Ridottos at guinea-tickets, for which
you are to have a supper and music. I was
there last night [May 25],'&mdash;the writer adds,&mdash;'but
did not find the joy of it,'<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and, at present,
he prefers Vauxhall, because of the approach by
water, that '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trajet du fleuve fatal</i>,'&mdash;as it is
styled in the <cite>Vauxhall de Londres</cite> which a
French poet dedicated in 1769 to M. de
Fontenelle. He seems, however, to have taken
Lord Orford to Ranelagh, and he records in
July that they walked with a train at their heels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>like two chairmen going to fight,&mdash;from which
he argues a return of his father's popularity.
Two years later Fashion has declared itself on
the side of the new garden, and Walpole has
gone over to the side of Fashion. 'Every night
constantly [he tells Conway] I go to Ranelagh;
which has totally beat Vauxhall. Nobody goes
anywhere else,&mdash;everybody goes there. My
Lord Chesterfield is so fond of it that he says
he has ordered all his letters to be directed
thither. If you had never seen it, I would make
you a most pompous description of it, and tell
you how the floor is all of beaten princes; that
you can't set your foot without treading on
a Prince of Wales or Duke of Cumberland.
The company is universal: there is from his
Grace of Grafton down to children out of the
Foundling Hospital; from my Lady Townshend
to the kitten; from my Lord Sandys to your
humble cousin and sincere friend.'<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>After Lord Orford's death, the next landmark
in Horace Walpole's life is his removal to the
house at Twickenham, subsequently known as
Strawberry Hill. To a description of this historical
mansion the next chapter will be in part
devoted. In the mean time we may linger for
a moment upon the record which these letters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>contain of the famous '45. No better opportunity
will probably occur of exhibiting Walpole
as the reporter of history in the process of
making. Much that he tells Mann and Montagu
is no doubt little more than the skimming
of the last <cite>Gazette</cite>; but he had always access to
trustworthy information, and is seldom a dull
reporter, even of newspaper news. Almost the
next letter to that in which he dwells at length
upon the loss of his father, records the disaster
of Tournay, or Fontenoy, in which, he tells
Mann, Mr. Conway has highly distinguished
himself, magnificently engaging&mdash;as appears
from a subsequent communication&mdash;no less than
two French Grenadiers at once. His account of
the battle is bare enough; but what apparently
interests him most is the patriotic conduct of
the Prince of Wales, who made a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chanson</i> on
the occasion, after the fashion of the Regent
Orléans:&mdash;</p>

<p>The goddesses addressed were Lady Catherine
Hanmer, Lady Fauconberg, and Lady
Middlesex, who played Congreve's <cite>Judgment
of Paris</cite> at Leicester House, with his Royal
Highness as Paris, and Prince Lobkowitz for
Mercury. Walpole says of the song that it
'miscarried in nothing but the language, the
thoughts, and the poetry.' Yet he copies the
whole five verses, of which the above are two,
for Mann's delectation.</p>

<p>A more logical sequence to Fontenoy than
the lyric of Leicester House is the descent of
Charles Edward upon Scotland. In August
Walpole reports to Mann that there is a proclamation
out 'for apprehending the Pretender's
son,' who had landed in July; in September he
is marching on Edinburgh. Ten days later the
writer is speculating half ruefully upon the possibilities
of being turned out of his comfortable
sinecures in favour of some forlorn Irish peer.
'I shall wonderfully dislike being a loyal suf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>ferer
in a threadbare coat, and shivering in an
ante-chamber at Hanover, or reduced to teach
Latin and English to the young princes at Copenhagen.
The Dowager Strafford has already
written cards for my Lady Nithsdale, my Lady
Tullibardine, the Duchess of Perth and Berwick,
and twenty more revived peeresses, to invite
them to play at whisk, Monday three months;
for your part, you will divert yourself with their
old taffeties, and tarnished slippers, and their
awkwardness, the first day they go to Court in
shifts and clean linen. Will you ever write to
me in my garret at Herrenhausen?'<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Then
upon this come the contradictions of rumour, the
'general supineness,' the raising of regiments,
and the disaster of Preston Pans, with its inevitable
condemnation of Cope. 'I pity poor him,
who, with no shining abilities, and no experience,
and no force, was sent to fight for a crown!
He never saw a battle but that of Dettingen,
where he got his red ribbon; Churchill, whose
led-captain he was, and my Lord Harrington,
had pushed him up to this misfortune.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>have lost all our artillery, five hundred men
taken&mdash;and <em>three</em> killed, and several officers, as
you will see in the papers. This defeat has
frightened everybody but those it rejoices, and
those it should frighten most; but my Lord
Granville still buoys up the King's spirits, and
persuades him it is nothing.'<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Nothing, indeed, it proved in the issue. But
Walpole was wiser in his immediate apprehensions
than King George's advisers, who were
not wise. In his subsequent letters we get
scattered glimpses of the miserable story that
ended in Culloden. Towards the end of October
he is auguring hopefully from the protracted
neglect of the rebels to act upon their success.
In November they are in England. But the
backwardness of the Jacobites to join them is
already evident, and he writes 'in the greatest
confidence of our getting over this ugly business.'
Early in December they have reached Derby,
only to be soon gone again, miserably harassed,
and leaving their sick and cannon behind. With
the new year come tidings to Mann that the
rebellion is dying down in England, and that
General Hawley has marched northward to put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>it quite out. Once more, on the 23rd February,
it flares fitfully at Falkirk, and then fades as suddenly.
The battle that Walpole hourly expects,
not without some trepidation, for Conway is
one of the Duke of Cumberland's aides-de-camp,
is still deferred, and it is April before the
two armies face each other on Culloden Moor.
Then he writes jubilantly to his Florentine correspondent:
'On the 16th, the Duke, by
forced marches, came up with the rebels a little
on this side Inverness,&mdash;by the way, the battle
is not christened yet; I only know that neither
Preston Pans nor Falkirk are to be god-fathers.
The rebels, who had fled from him after their
victory [of Falkirk], and durst not attack him,
when so much exposed to them at his passage
of the Spey, now stood him, they seven thousand,
he ten. They broke through Barril's
regiment and killed Lord Robert Kerr, a handsome
young gentleman, who was cut to pieces
with about thirty wounds; but they were soon
repulsed, and fled; the whole engagement not
lasting above a quarter of an hour. The young
Pretender escaped, Mr. Conway says, he
hears, wounded: he certainly was in the rear.
They have lost above a thousand men in the
engagement and pursuit; and six hundred were
already taken; among which latter are their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
French Ambassador and Earl Kilmarnock. The
Duke of Perth and Lord Ogilvie are said to be
slain.... Except Lord Robert Kerr, we lost
nobody of note: Sir Robert Rich's eldest son
has lost his hand, and about a hundred and
thirty private men fell. The defeat is reckoned
total, and the dispersion general; and all their
artillery is taken. It is a brave young Duke!
The town is all blazing round me [<i>i. e.</i>, at
Arlington Street] as I write, with fireworks and
illuminations: I have some inclination to wrap
up half-a-dozen sky-rockets, to make you drink
the Duke's health. Mr. Dodington [in Pall
Mall], on the first report, came out with a very
pretty illumination,&mdash;so pretty that I believe he
had it by him, ready for <em>any</em> occasion.'<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Walpole's account of these occurrences is, of
course, hearsay, although, as regards Culloden,
he probably derived the details from Conway,
who was present. But in some of the events
which ensued, he is either actually a spectator
himself, or fresh from direct communication
with those who have been spectators. One of
the most graphic passages in his entire correspondence
is his description of the trial of the
rebel lords, at which he assisted; and another
is his narrative of the executions of Kilmarnock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>and Balmerino, written down from the relation
of eye-witnesses. It is hardly possible to get
much nearer to history.</p>

<p>'I am this moment come from the conclusion
of the greatest and most melancholy scene I
ever yet saw! You will easily guess it was
the Trials of the rebel Lords. As it was the
most interesting sight, it was the most solemn
and fine: a coronation is a puppet-show, and
all the splendour of it idle; but this sight at
once feasted one's eyes and engaged all one's
passions. It began last Monday; three parts
of Westminster-hall were inclosed with galleries,
and hung with scarlet; and the whole
ceremony was conducted with the most awful
solemnity and decency, except in the one point
of leaving the prisoners at the bar, amidst the
idle curiosity of some crowd, and even with the
witnesses who had sworn against them, while
the Lords adjourned to their own House to consult.
No part of the royal family was there,
which was a proper regard to the unhappy men,
who were become their victims.... I had
armed myself with all the resolution I could,
with the thought of their crimes and of the
danger past, and was assisted by the sight of
the Marquis of Lothian in weepers for his son
[Lord Robert Kerr], who fell at Culloden;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
but the first appearance of the prisoners shocked
me! their behaviour melted me.' After going
on to speak of Lord Kilmarnock and Lord
Cromartie (afterwards reprieved), he continues:
'For Lord Balmerino, he is the most natural
brave old fellow I ever saw: the highest intrepidity,
even to indifference. At the bar he
behaved like a soldier and a man; in the intervals
of form, with carelessness and humour.
He pressed extremely to have his wife, his
pretty Peggy [Margaret Chalmers], with him in
the Tower, Lady Cromartie only sees her
husband through the grate, not choosing to be
shut up with him, as she thinks she can serve
him better by her intercession without: she is
big with child and very handsome: so are their
daughters. When they were to be brought from
the Tower in separate coaches, there was some
dispute in which the axe must go: old Balmerino
cried, 'Come, come, put it with me.'
At the bar he plays with his fingers upon the
axe, while he talks to the gentleman-gaoler;
and one day somebody coming up to listen, he
took the blade and held it like a fan between
their faces. During the trial, a little boy was
near him, but not tall enough to see; he made
room for the child, and placed him near himself.'<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>
<p>Balmerino's gallant demeanour evidently fascinated
Walpole. In his next letter he relates
how on his way back to the Tower the sturdy
old dragoon had stopped the coach at Charing
Cross to buy some 'honey-blobs' (gooseberries);
and when afterwards he comes to write
his account of the execution, although he tells
the story of Kilmarnock's death with feeling,
the best passage is given to his companion in
misfortune. He describes how, on the fatal
15th August, before he left the Tower, Balmerino
drank a bumper to King James; how he wore
his rebellious regimentals (blue and red) over a
flannel waistcoat and his shroud; how, embracing
Lord Kilmarnock, he said, 'My Lord, I
wish I could suffer for both.' Then followed
the beheading of Kilmarnock; and the narrator
goes on: 'The scaffold was immediately
new-strewed with sawdust, the block new covered,
the executioner new-dressed, and a new
axe brought. Then came old Balmerino, treading
with the air of a general. As soon as he
mounted the scaffold, he read the inscription on
his coffin, as he did again afterwards: he then
surveyed the spectators, who were in amazing
numbers, even upon masts upon ships in the
river; and pulling out his spectacles, read a
treasonable speech, which he delivered to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Sheriff, and said, the young Pretender was so
sweet a Prince that flesh and blood could not
resist following him; and lying down to try the
block, he said, 'If I had a thousand lives, I
would lay them all down here in the same
cause.' He said if he had not taken the sacrament
the day before, he would have knocked
down Williamson, the Lieutenant of the Tower,
for his ill-usage of him. He took the axe and
felt it, and asked the headsman how many blows
he had given Lord Kilmarnock; and gave him
three guineas. Two clergymen, who attended
him, coming up, he said, 'No, gentlemen, I
believe you have already done me all the service
you can.' Then he went to the corner of the
scaffold, and called very loud for the warder, to
give him his perriwig, which he took off, and
put on a night-cap of Scotch plaid, and then
pulled off his coat and waistcoat and lay down;
but being told he was on the wrong side, vaulted
round, and immediately gave the sign by tossing
up his arm, as if he were giving the signal for
battle. He received three blows; but the first
certainly took away all sensation. He was not
a quarter of an hour on the scaffold; Lord
Kilmarnock above half a one. Balmerino certainly
died with the intrepidity of a hero, but
the insensibility of one too. As he walked from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
his prison to execution, seeing every window
and top of house filled with spectators, he cried
out, "Look, look, how they are all piled up
like rotten oranges."'<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>In the old print of the execution, the scaffold
on Tower Hill is shown surrounded by a wide
square of dragoons, beyond which the crowd&mdash;'the
immense display of human countenances
which surrounded it like a sea,' as Scott has it&mdash;are
visible on every side. No. 14 Tower
Hill is said to have been the house from which
the two lords were led to the block, and a trail
of blood along the hall and up the first flight of
stairs was long shown as indicating the route by
which the mutilated bodies were borne to await
interment in St. Peter's Chapel. A few months
later Walpole records the execution in the same
place of Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat, the cunning
old Jacobite, whose characteristic attitude and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>'pawky' expression live for ever in the admirable
sketch which Hogarth made of him at St.
Albans. He died (says Walpole) 'extremely
well, without passion, affectation, buffoonery,
or timidity.' But he is not so distinguished as
either Kilmarnock or Balmerino, and, however
Roman his taking-off, the chief memorable thing
about it is, that it was happily the last of these
sanguinary scenes in this country. The only
other incident which it is here needful to chronicle
in connection with the 'Forty Five' is
Walpole's verses on the Suppression of the late
Rebellion. On the 4th and 5th November, the
anniversaries of King William's birth and landing,
it was the custom to play Rowe's <cite>Tamerlane</cite>,
and this year (1746) the epilogue spoken
by Mrs. Pritchard 'in the Character of the
Comic Muse' was from Walpole's pen. According
to the writer, special terrors had threatened
the stage from the advent of 'Rome's young missionary
spark,' the Chevalier, and the Tragic
Muse, raising, 'to eyes well-tutor'd in the trade
of grief,' 'a small and well-lac'd handkerchief,'
is represented by her lighter sister as bewailing
the prospect to her 'buskined progeny' after
this fashion:&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>After this the epilogue digresses into a comparison
of the Duke of Cumberland with King
William. Virgil, Juvenal, Addison, Dryden,
and Pope, upon one of whose lines on Cibber
Walpole bases his reference to the Lord Chamberlain,
are all laid under contribution in this
performance. It 'succeeded to flatter me,' he
tells Mann a few days later,&mdash;a Gallicism from
which we must infer an enthusiastic reception.</p>

<p>Walpole's personal and domestic history does
not present much interest at this period. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>sister Mary (Catherine Shorter's daughter), who
had married the third Earl of Cholmondeley,
had died long before her mother. In February,
1746, his half-sister, Lady Mary, his playmate
at comet in the Houghton days, married Mr.
Churchill,&mdash;'a foolish match,' in Horace's
opinion, to which he will have nothing to say.
With his second brother, Sir Edward Walpole,
he seems to have had but little intercourse, and
that scarcely of a fraternal character. In 1857,
Cunningham published for the first time a very
angry letter from Edward to his junior, in which
the latter was bitterly reproached for his interference
in disposing of the family borough of
Castle Rising, and (incidentally) for his assumption
of superiority, mental and otherwise. To
this communication Walpole prepared a most
caustic and categorical answer, which, however,
he never sent. For his nieces, Edward
Walpole's natural daughters, of whom it will be
more convenient to speak later, Horace seems
always to have felt a sincere regard. But
although his brother had tastes which must have
been akin to his own, for Edward Walpole was
in his way an art patron (Roubillac the sculptor,
for instance, was much indebted to him) and a
respectable musician, no real cordiality ever
existed between them. 'There is nothing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the world'&mdash;he tells Montagu in May, 1745&mdash;'the
Baron of Englefield has such an aversion
for as for his brother.'<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>For his eldest brother's wife, the Lady
Walpole who had formed one of the learned
trio at Florence, he entertained no kind of
respect, and his letters are full of flouts at her
Ladyship's manners and morality. Indeed,
between <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">préciosité</i> and 'Platonic love,' her
life does not appear to have been a particularly
worshipful one, and her long sojourn under
Italian skies had not improved her. At present
she was Lady Orford, her husband, who is seldom
mentioned, and from whom she had been
living apart, having succeeded to the title at his
father's death. From Walpole's letters to Mann,
it seems that in April, 1745, she was, much to
the dismay of her relatives, already preening
her wings for England. In September, she has
arrived, and Walpole is maliciously delighted at
the cold welcome she obtains from the Court
and from society in general, with the exception
of her old colleague, Lady Pomfret, and that
in one sense congenial spirit, Lady Townshend.
Later on, a definite separation from her hus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>band
appears to have been agreed upon, which
Walpole fondly hopes may have the effect of
bringing about her departure for Italy. 'The
Ladies O[rford] and T[ownshend]'&mdash;he says&mdash;'have
exhausted scandal both in their persons
and conversations.' However much this
may be exaggerated (and Walpole never spares
his antipathies), the last we hear of Lady
Orford is certainly on his side, for she has
retired from town to a villa near Richmond with
a lover for whom she has postponed that
southward flight which her family so ardently
desired. This fortunate Endymion, the Hon.
Sewallis Shirley, son of Robert, first Earl
Ferrers, had already been one of the most
favoured lovers of the notorious 'lady of quality'
whose memoirs were afterwards foisted into
<cite>Peregrine Pickle</cite>. To Lady Vane now succeeded
Lady Orford, as eminent for wealth&mdash;says
sarcastic Lady Mary Wortley Montagu&mdash;as
her predecessor had been for beauty, and equal
in her 'heroic contempt for shame.' This new
connection was destined to endure. It was in
September, 1746, that Walpole chronicled his
sister-in-law's latest frailty, and in May, 1751,
only a few weeks after her husband's death,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>she married Shirley at the Rev. Alexander
Keith's convenient little chapel in May Fair.'</p>

<p>In 1744, died Alexander Pope, to be followed
a year later by the great Dean of St.
Patrick's. Neither of these events leaves any
lasting mark in Walpole's correspondence,&mdash;indeed
of Swift's death there is no mention at
all. A nearer bereavement was the premature
loss of West, which had taken place two years
before, closing sorrowfully with faint accomplishment
a life of promise. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vale, et vive paulisper cum
vivis</i>,&mdash;he had written a few days earlier
to Gray,&mdash;his friend to the last. With Gray,
Walpole's friendship, as will be seen presently,
had been resumed. His own literary essays
still lie chiefly in the domain of squib and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu
d'esprit</i>. In April, 1746, over the appropriate
signature of 'Descartes,' he printed in No. II. of
<cite>The Museum</cite> a 'Scheme for Raising a Large Sum
of Money for the Use of the Government,
by laying a tax on Message-Cards and Notes,'
and in No. V. a pretended Advertisement and
Table of Contents for a <cite>History of Good Breeding,
from the Creation of the World</cite>, by the
Author of the Whole Duty of Man. The wit
of this is a little laboured, and scarcely goes
beyond the announcement that 'The Eight last
Volumes, which relate to <em>Germany</em>, may be had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
separate;' nor does that of the other exceed a
mild reflection of Fielding's manner in some of
his minor pieces. Among other things, we
gather that it was the custom of the fine ladies
of the day to send open messages on blank playing-cards;
and it is stated as a fact or a fancy
that 'after the fatal day of Fontenoy,' persons
of quality 'all wrote their notes on Indian paper,
which, being red, when inscribed with Japan ink
made a melancholy military kind of elegy on the
brave youths who occasioned the fashion, and
were often the honourable subject of the epistle.'
The only remaining effort of any importance at
this time is the little poem of <cite>The Beauties</cite>,
somewhat recalling Gay's Prologue to the
<cite>Shepherd's Week</cite>, and written in July, 1746, to
Eckardt the painter. Here is a specimen:&mdash;</p>

<p>In August, 1746, Walpole announces to Mann
that he has taken a pretty house within the precincts
of the castle at Windsor, to which he is

Gray tells Wharton that he sees him 'usually
once a week.' 'All is mighty free, and even

one of the first things posted off to Conway, is
Gray's <cite>Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College</cite>,
which the sender desires he 'will please

retreat by the arrival of a young Florentine
friend, the Marquis Rinuncini, to whom he has
to do the London honours. 'I stayed literally
an entire week with him, carried him to see

<p>On the 5th of June, 1747, Walpole announces
to Mann that he has taken a little new
farm, just out of Twickenham. 'The house is
so small that I can send it to you in a letter to
look at: the prospect is as delightful as possible,
commanding the river, the town [Twickenham],
and Richmond Park; and, being situated on a
hill, descends to the Thames through two or
three little meadows, where I have some Turkish
sheep and two cows, all studied in their colours
for becoming the view. This little rural <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bijou</i>
was Mrs. Chenevix's, the toy woman <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la mode</i>,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>who in every dry season is to furnish me with
the best rain water from Paris, and now and
then with some Dresden-china cows, who are
to figure like wooden classics in a library; so I
shall grow as much a shepherd as any swain in
the Astræa.' Three days later, further details
are added in a letter to Conway, then in
Flanders with the Duke of Cumberland:
'You perceive by my date [Twickenham, 8
June] that I am got into a new camp, and have
left my tub at Windsor. It is a little play-thing-house,
that I got out of Mrs. Chenevix's shop,
and is the prettiest bauble you ever saw. It is
set in enamelled meadows, with filagree hedges:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse">And little finches wave their wings in gold."'<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>'Two delightful roads, that you would call
dusty, supply me continually with coaches and
chaises; barges as solemn as Barons of the
Exchequer move under my window; Richmond
Hill and Ham Walks bound my prospect; ...
Dowagers as plenty as flounders inhabit all
around, and Pope's ghost is just now skimming
under my window by a most poetical moonlight.
I have about land enough to keep such
a farm as Noah's, when he set up in the ark
with a pair of each kind; but my cottage is
rather cleaner than I believe his was after they
had been cooped up together forty days. The
Chenevixes had tricked it out for themselves:
up two pair of stairs is what they call Mr.
Chenevix's library, furnished with three maps,
one shelf, a bust of Sir Isaac Newton, and a
lame telescope without any glasses. Lord John
Sackville <em>predecessed</em> me here, and instituted
certain games called <em>cricketalia</em>, which have
been celebrated this very evening in honour of
him in a neighbouring meadow.'<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>The house thus whimsically described, which
grew into the Gothic structure afterwards so
closely associated with its owner's name, was
not, even at this date, without its history. It
stood on the left bank of the Thames, at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>corner of the Upper Road to Teddington, not
very far from Twickenham itself. It had been
built about 1698 as a 'country box' by a
retired coachman of the Earl of Bradford, and,
from the fact that he was supposed to have
acquired his means by starving his master's
horses, was known popularly as Chopped-Straw
Hall. Its earliest possessor not long afterwards
let it out as a lodging-house, and finally,
after several improvements, sub-let it altogether.
One of its first tenants was Colley Cibber, who
found it convenient when he was in attendance
for acting at Hampton Court; and he is said
to have written in it the comedy called <cite>The
Refusal; or, the Ladies' Philosophy</cite>, produced
at Drury Lane in 1721. Then, for eight years,
it was rented by the Bishop of Durham, Dr.
Talbot, who was reported to have kept in it a
better table than the extent of its kitchen
seemed, in Walpole's judgement, to justify. After
the Bishop came a Marquis, Henry Bridges,
son of the Duke of Chandos; after the Marquis,
Mrs. Chenevix, the toy-woman, who, upon
her husband's death, let it for two years to the
nobleman who <em>predecessed</em> Walpole, Lord John
Philip Sackville. Before this, Mrs. Chenevix
had taken lodgers, one of whom was the celebrated
theologian, Père Le Courrayer. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
expiration of Lord John Sackville's tenancy,
Walpole took the remainder of Mrs. Chenevix's
lease; and in 1748 had grown to like the situation
so much that he obtained a special act to
purchase the fee simple from the existing possessors,
three minors of the name of Mortimer.
The price he paid was £1356 10<i>s.</i> Nothing
was then wanting but the name, and in looking
over some old deeds this was supplied. He
found that the ground on which it stood had
been known originally as 'Strawberry-Hill-Shot.'
'You shall hear from me,' he tells Mann in
June, 1748, 'from <span class="smcap">Strawberry Hill</span>, which I
have found out in my lease is the old name of
my house; so pray, never call it Twickenham
again.'</p>

<p>The transformation of the toy-woman's 'villakin'
into a Gothic residence was not, however,
the operation of a day. Indeed, at first, the
idea of rebuilding does not seem to have
entered its new owner's mind. But he speedily
set about extending his boundaries, for before
26 December, 1748, he has added nine acres to
his original five, making fourteen in all,&mdash;a 'territory
prodigious in a situation where land is so
scarce.' Among the tenants of some of the
buildings which he acquired in making these
additions was Richard Francklin, the printer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of the <cite>Craftsman</cite>, who, during Sir Robert
Walpole's administration, had been taken up
for printing that paper. He occupied a small
house in what was afterwards known as the
Flower Garden, and Walpole permitted him to
retain it during his lifetime. Walpole's letters
towards the close of 1748 contain numerous
references to his assiduity in planting. 'My
present and sole occupation' he says in August,
'is planting, in which I have made great
progress, and talk very learnedly with the
nurserymen, except that now and then a lettuce
run to seed overturns all my botany, as I have
more than once taken it for a curious West
Indian flowering shrub. Then the deliberation
with which trees grow is extremely inconvenient
to my natural impatience.' Two months
later he is 'all plantation, and sprouts away like
any chaste nymph in the <cite>Metamorphosis</cite>.' In
December, we begin to hear of that famous
lawn so well known in the later history of the
house. He is 'making a terrace the whole
breadth of his garden on the brow of a natural
hill, with meadows at the foot, and commanding
the river, the village [Twickenham], Richmond-hill,
and the park, and part of Kingston' A
year after this (September, 1749), while he is
still 'digging and planting till it is dark,' come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the first dreams of building. At Cheney's, in
Buckinghamshire, he has seen some old stained
glass, in the windows of an ancient house which
had been degraded into a farm, and he thinks
he will beg it of the Duke of Bedford (to
whom the farm belongs), as it would be 'magnificent
for Strawberry-castle.' Evidently he
has discussed this (as yet) <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">château en Espagne</i>
with Montagu. 'Did I tell you [he says] that
I have found a text in Deuteronomy to authorise
my future battlements? "When thou buildest
a new house, then shalt thou make a battlement
for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thy
house, if any man fall from thence."' In January,
the new building is an established fact, as
far as purpose is concerned. In a postscript to
Mann he writes: 'I must trouble you with a
commission, which I don't know whether you
can execute. <em>I am going to build a little gothic
castle at Strawberry Hill.</em> If you can pick me
up any fragments of old painted glass, arms, or
anything, I shall be excessively obliged to you.
I can't say I remember any such things in Italy;
but out of old chateaus, I imagine, one might
get it cheap, if there is any.'</p>

<p>From a subsequent letter it would seem that
Mann, as a resident in Italy, had rather expostulated
against the style of architecture which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
his friend was about to adopt, and had suggested
the Grecian. But Walpole, rightly
or wrongly, knew what he intended. 'The
Grecian,' he said, was 'only proper for magnificent
and public buildings. Columns and all
their beautiful ornaments look ridiculous when
crowded into a closet or a cheesecake-house.
The variety is little, and admits no charming
irregularities. I am almost as fond of the
<em>Sharawaggi</em>, or Chinese want of symmetry, in
buildings, as in grounds or gardens. I am sure,
whenever you come to England, you will be
pleased with the liberty of taste into which we
are struck, and of which you can have no idea.'
The passage shows that he himself anticipated
some of the ridicule which was levelled by unsympathetic
people at the 'oyster-grotto-like
profanation' which he gradually erected by the
Thames. In the mean time it went on progressing
slowly, as its progress was entirely
dependent on his savings out of income; and the
references to it in his letters, perhaps because
Mann was doubtful, are not abundant. 'The
library and refectory, or great parlour,' he says
in his description, 'were entirely new built in
1753; the gallery, round tower, great cloyster,
and cabinet, in 1760 and 1761; and the great
north bedchamber in 1770.' To speak of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
later alterations would be to anticipate too
much, and the further description of Strawberry
Hill will be best deferred until his own account
of the house and contents was printed in 1774,
four years after the last addition above recorded.
But even before he made the earliest of them,
he must have done much to alter and improve
the aspect of the place, for Gray, more admiring
than Mann, praises what has been done.
'I am glad,' he tells Wharton, 'that you enter
into the spirit of Strawberry-castle. It has a
purity and propriety of Gothicism in it (with
very few exceptions) that I have not seen elsewhere;'
and in an earlier letter he implies that
its 'extreme littleness' is its chief defect. But
here, before for the moment leaving the subject,
it is only fair to give the proprietor's own
description of Strawberry Hill at this date, <i>i. e.</i>,
in June, 1753. After telling Mann that it is
'so monastic' that he has 'a little hall decked
with long saints in lean arched windows and
with taper columns, which we call the Paraclete,
in memory of Eloisa's cloister,'<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> he sends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>him a sketch of it, and goes on: 'The enclosed
enchanted little landscape, then, is Strawberry
Hill.... This view of the castle is what I
have just finished [it was a view of the south
side, towards the north-east], and is the only
side that will be at all regular. Directly before
it is an open grove, through which you see a
field, which is bounded by a serpentine wood
of all kind of trees, and flowering shrubs, and
flowers. The lawn before the house is situated
on the top of a small hill, from whence to
the left you see the town and church of Twickenham
encircling a turn of the river, that looks
exactly like a sea-port in miniature. The opposite
shore is a most delicious meadow, bounded
by Richmond Hill, which loses itself in the
noble woods of the park to the end of the prospect
on the right, where is another turn of the
river, and the suburbs of Kingston as luckily
placed as Twickenham is on the left: and a
natural terrace on the brow of my hill, with
meadows of my own down to the river, commands
both extremities. Is not this a tolerable
prospect? You must figure that all this is perpetually
enlivened by a navigation of boats and
barges, and by a road below my terrace, with
coaches, post-chaises, waggons, and horsemen
constantly in motion, and the fields speckled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
with cows, horses, and sheep. Now you shall
walk into the house. The bow window below
leads into a little parlour hung with a stone-colour
Gothic paper and Jackson's Venetian
prints,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> which I could never endure while they
pretended, infamous as they are, to be after
Titian, etc., but when I gave them this air of
barbarous bas-reliefs, they succeeded to a miracle:
it is impossible at first sight not to conclude
that they contain the history of Attila or Tottila
done about the very æra. From hence, under
two gloomy arches, you come to the hall and
staircase, which it is impossible to describe to
you, as it is the most particular and chief beauty
of the castle. Imagine the walls covered with
(I call it paper, but it is really paper painted in
perspective to represent) Gothic fretwork: the
lightest Gothic balustrade to the staircase,
adorned with antelopes (our supporters) bearing
shields; lean windows fattened with rich saints
in painted glass, and a vestibule open with three
arches on the landing place, and niches full of
trophies of old coats of mail, Indian shields made
of rhinoceros's hides, broadswords, quivers, long-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>bows,
arrows, and spears,&mdash;all <em>supposed</em> to be
taken by Sir Terry Robsart [an ancestor of Sir
Robert Walpole] in the holy wars. But as none
of this regards the enclosed drawing, I will pass
to that. The room on the ground floor nearest
to you is a bedchamber, hung with yellow paper
and prints, framed in a new manner, invented by
Lord Cardigan; that is, with black and white
borders printed. Over this is Mr. Chute's bed-chamber,
hung with red in the same manner.
The bow-window room one pair of stairs is not
yet finished; but in the tower beyond it is the
charming closet where I am now writing to you.
It is hung with green paper and water-colour
pictures; has two windows: the one in the
drawing looks to the garden, the other to the
beautiful prospect; and the top of each glutted
with the richest painted glass of the arms of
England, crimson roses, and twenty other pieces
of green, purple, and historic bits. I must tell
you, by the way, that the castle, when finished,
will have two-and-thirty windows enriched with
painted glass. In this closet, which is Mr.
Chute's College of Arms, are two presses
of books of heraldry and antiquities, Madame
Sévigné's Letters, and any French books that
relate to her and her acquaintance. Out of this
closet is the room where we always live, hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
with a blue and white paper in stripes adorned
with festoons, and a thousand plump chairs,
couches, and luxurious settees covered with
linen of the same pattern, and with a bow
window commanding the prospect, and gloomed
with limes that shade half each window, already
darkened with painted glass in chiaroscuro, set
in deep blue glass. Under this room is a cool
little hall, where we generally dine, hung with
paper to imitate Dutch tiles.</p>

<p>'I have described so much that you will begin
to think that all the accounts I used to give
you of the diminutiveness of our habitation
were fabulous; but it is really incredible how
small most of the rooms are. The only two
good chambers I shall have are not yet built:
they will be an eating-room and a library, each
twenty by thirty, and the latter fifteen feet
high. For the rest of the house, I could send
it to you in this letter as easily as the drawing,
only that I should have nowhere to live until
the return of the post. The Chinese summer-house,
which you may distinguish in the distant
landscape, belongs to my Lord Radnor.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>pique ourselves upon nothing but simplicity,
and have no carvings, gildings, paintings, inlayings,
or tawdry businesses.'<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>From this it will appear that in June, 1753,
the library and refectory were not yet built, so
that when he says, in the printed description,
that they were new built in 1753, he must mean
no more than that they had been begun. In
a later letter, of May, 1754, they were still
unfinished. Meanwhile the house is gradually
attracting more and more attention. George
Montagu comes, and is 'in raptures and screams,
and hoops, and hollas, and dances, and crosses
himself a thousand times over.' The next visitor
is 'Nolkejumskoi,'&mdash;otherwise the Duke
of Cumberland,&mdash;who inspects it much after the
fashion of a gracious Gulliver surveying a castle
in Lilliput. Afterwards, attracted by the reports
of Lady Hervey and Mr. Bristow (brother of
the Countess of Buckingham), arrives my Lord
Bath, who is stirred into celebrating it to the
tune of a song of Bubb Dodington on Mrs.
Strawbridge. His Lordship does not seem to
have got further than two stanzas; but Walpole,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>not to leave so complimentary a tribute in the
depressed condition of a fragment, discreetly
revised and completed it himself. The lines
may fairly find a place here as an example of
his lighter muse. The first and third verses are
Lord Bath's, the rest being obviously written
in order to bring in 'Nolkejumskoi' and some
personal friends:&mdash;</p>

<p>Cumberland Lodge, where, say the old guide-books,
the hero of Culloden 'reposed after
victory,' still stands on the hill at the end of
the Long Walk at Windsor; and at 'Gunnersbury'
lived the Princess Amelia. All the other
houses referred to are in existence. 'Sweet
Marble-hill,' which, like Strawberry, was not
long ago put up for sale, had at this date for
mistress the Countess Dowager of Suffolk (Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>Howard), for whom it had been built by her
royal lover, George II.; and Chiswick House,
(now the Marquis of Bute's), that famous
structure of Kent which Lord Hervey said was
'too small to inhabit, and too large to hang to
one's watch,' was the residence of Richard,
Earl of Burlington. Claremont 'kept so jim'
[neat], was the seat of the Duke of Newcastle
at Esher; Oatlands, near Weybridge, belonged
to the Duke of York, and Sion House, on the
Thames, to the Duke of Northumberland.
Walpole and his friends, it will be perceived,
did not shrink from comparing small things with
great. But perhaps the most notable circumstance
about this glorification of Strawberry is
that it should have originated with its reputed
author. 'Can there be,' says Walpole, 'an odder
revolution of things, than that the printer of
the <cite>Craftsman</cite> should live in a house of mine,
and that the author of the <cite>Craftsman</cite> should
write a panegyric on a house of mine?' The
printer was Richard Francklin, already mentioned
as his tenant; and Lord Bath, if not the
actual, was at least the putative, writer of most
of the <cite>Craftsman's</cite> attacks upon Sir Robert
Walpole. It is possible, however, that, as
with the poem, part only of this honour really
belonged to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Strawberry Hill and its improvements have,
however, carried us far from the date at which
this chapter begins, and we must return to
1747. Happily the life of Walpole, though
voluminously chronicled in his correspondence,
is not so crowded with personal incident as to
make a space of six years a serious matter to
recover, especially when tested by the brief
but still very detailed record in the <cite>Short Notes</cite>
of what he held to be its conspicuous occurrences.
In 1747-49 his zeal for his father's
memory involved him in a good deal of party
pamphleteering, and in 1749, he had what he
styles 'a remarkable quarrel' with the Speaker,
of which one may say that, in these days, it
would scarcely deserve its qualifying epithet,
although it produced more paper war. 'These
things [he says himself] were only excusable by
the lengths to which party had been carried
against my father; or rather, were not excusable
even then.' For this reason it is needless
to dwell upon them here, as well as upon certain
other papers in <cite>The Remembrancer</cite> for
1749, and a tract called <cite>Delenda est Oxonia</cite>,
prompted by a heinous scheme, which was meditated
by the Ministry, of attacking the liberties
of that University by vesting in the Crown the
nomination of the Chancellor. This piece [he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
says], which I think one of my best, was seized
at the printer's and suppressed.' Then in November,
1749, comes something like a really
'moving incident,'&mdash;he is robbed in Hyde
Park. He was returning by moonlight to
Arlington Street from Lord Holland's, when his
coach was stopped by two of the most notorious
of 'Diana's foresters,'&mdash;Plunket and James
Maclean; and the adventure had all but a tragic
termination. Maclean's pistol went off by accident,
sending a bullet so nearly through
Walpole's head that it grazed the skin under
his eye, stunned him, and passed through the
roof of the chariot. His correspondence contains
no more than a passing reference to this
narrow escape,&mdash;probably because it was amply
reported (and expanded) in the public prints.
But in a paper which he contributed to the
<cite>World</cite> a year or two later, under guise of
relating what had happened to one of his
acquaintance, he reverts to this experience.
'The whole affair [he says] was conducted with
the greatest good-breeding on both sides. The
robber, who had only taken a purse <em>this way</em>,
because he had that morning been disappointed
of marrying a great fortune, no sooner returned
to his lodgings, than he sent the gentleman
[<i>i. e.</i>, Walpole himself] two letters of excuses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
which, with less wit than the epistles of Voiture,
had ten times more natural and easy politeness in
the turn of their expression. In the postscript,
he appointed a meeting at Tyburn at twelve
at night, where the gentleman might <em>purchase
again</em> any trifles he had lost; and my friend has
been blamed for not accepting the rendezvous,
as it seemed liable to be construed by ill-natured
people into a doubt of the <em>honour</em> of a man
who had given him all the satisfaction in his
power for having <em>unluckily</em> been near shooting
him through the head.'<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>The 'fashionable highwayman' (as Mr.
Maclean was called) was taken soon afterwards,
and hanged. 'I am honourably mentioned
in a Grub-street ballad [says Walpole]
for not having contributed to his sentence;' and
he goes on to say that there are as many prints
and pamphlets about him as about that other
sensation of 1750, the earthquake. Maclean
seems nevertheless to have been rather a pinchbeck
Macheath; but for the moment, in default
of larger lions, he was the rage. After his condemnation,
several thousand people visited him
in his cell at Newgate where he is stated to
have fainted twice from the heat and pressure
of the crowd. And his visitors were not all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>men. In a note to <cite>The Modern Fine Lady</cite>,
Soame Jenyns says that some of the brightest
eyes were in tears for him; and Walpole himself
tells us that he excited the warmest commiseration
in two distinguished beauties of the
day, Lady Caroline Petersham and Miss Ashe.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Miss Ashe, of whom we are told mysteriously
by the commentators that she 'was said to
have been of very high parentage,' and Lady
Caroline Petersham, a daughter of the Duke
of Grafton, figure more pleasantly in another
letter of Walpole, which gives a glimpse of some
of those diversions with which he was wont to
relieve the gothicising of his villa by the Thames.
In a sentence that proves how well he understood
his own qualities, he says he tells the
story 'to show the manners of the age, which
are always as entertaining to a person fifty miles
off as to one born an hundred and fifty years
after the time.' We have not yet reached the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>later limit; but there is little doubt as to the
interest of Walpole's account of his visit in
the month of June, 1750, to the famous gardens
of Mr. Jonathan Tyers. He got a card, he says,
from Lady Caroline to go with her to Vauxhall.
He repairs accordingly to her house, and finds
her 'and the little Ashe, or the Pollard Ashe,
as they call her,' having 'just finished their last
layer of red, and looking as handsome as crimson
could make them.' Others of the party
are the Duke of Kingston; Lord March, of
Thackeray's <cite>Virginians</cite>; Harry Vane, soon to
be Earl of Darlington; Mr. Whitehead; a
'pretty Miss Beauclerc,' and a 'very foolish
Miss Sparre.' As they sail up the Mall, they
encounter cross-grained Lord Petersham (my
lady's husband) shambling along after his wont,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
and 'as sulky as a ghost that nobody will speak
to first.' He declines to accompany his wife
and her friends, who, getting into the best order
they can, march to their barge, which has a boat
of French horns attending, and 'little Ashe'
sings. After parading up the river, they 'debark'
at Vauxhall, where at the outset they narrowly
escape the excitement of a quarrel. For a certain
Mrs. Lloyd, of Spring Gardens, afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>married to Lord Haddington, observing Miss
Beauclerc and her companion following Lady
Caroline, says audibly, 'Poor girls, I am sorry
to see them in such bad company,'&mdash;a remark
which the 'foolish Miss Sparre' (she is but
fifteen), for the fun of witnessing a duel,
endeavours to make Lord March resent. But
my Lord, who is not only 'very lively and agreeable,'
but also of a nice discretion, laughs her
out of 'this charming frolic, with a great deal of
humour.' Next they pick up Lord Granby,
arriving very drunk from 'Jenny's Whim,' at
Chelsea, where he has left a mixed gathering
of thirteen persons of quality playing at Brag.
He is in the sentimental stage of his malady,
and makes love to Miss Beauclerc and Miss
Sparre alternately, until the tide of champagne
turns, and he remembers that he is married.
'At last,' says Walpole,&mdash;and at this point the
story may be surrendered to him entirely,&mdash;'we
assembled in our booth, Lady Caroline in the
front, with the visor of her hat erect, and looking
gloriously jolly and handsome. She had
fetched my brother Orford from the next box,
where he was enjoying himself with his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite
partie</i>, to help us to mince chickens. We
minced seven chickens into a china dish, which
Lady Caroline stewed over a lamp with three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
pats of butter and a flagon of water, stirring
and rattling and laughing, and we every minute
expecting to have the dish fly about our ears.
She had brought Betty, the fruit girl,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> with
hampers of strawberries and cherries from
Rogers's, and made her wait upon us, and then
made her sup by us at a little table. The conversation
was no less lively than the whole
transaction. There was a Mr. O'Brien arrived
from Ireland, who would get the Duchess of
Manchester from Mr. Hussey, if she were still
at liberty. I took up the biggest hautboy in
the dish, and said to Lady Caroline, "Madam,
Miss Ashe desires you would eat this O'Brien
strawberry;" she replied immediately, "I won't,
you hussey." You may imagine the laugh this
reply occasioned. After the tempest was a
little calmed, the Pollard said, "Now, how
anybody would spoil this story that was to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>repeat it, and say, "I won't, you jade." In short,
the whole air of our party was sufficient, as you
will easily imagine, to take up the whole attention
of the garden; so much so that from eleven
o'clock till half an hour after one we had the
whole concourse round our booth: at last, they
came into the little gardens of each booth on the
sides of our's, till Harry Vane took up a bumper,
and drank their healths, and was proceeding to
treat them with still greater freedom. It was
three o'clock before we got home.' He adds a
characteristic touch to explain Lord Granby's
eccentricities. He had lost eight hundred
pounds to the Prince of Wales at Kew the night
before, and this had a 'little ruffled' his lordship's
temper.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>Early in 1753, Edward Moore, the author of
some <cite>Fables for the Female Sex</cite>, once popular
enough to figure, between Thomson and Prior,
in Goldsmith's <cite>Beauties of English Poesy</cite>, established
the periodical paper called <cite>The World</cite>,
which, to quote a latter-day definition, might
fairly claim to be 'written by gentlemen for
gentlemen.' Soame Jenyns, Cambridge of the
<cite>Scribleriad</cite> (Walpole's Twickenham neighbour),
Hamilton Boyle, Sir Charles Hanbury Williams,
and Lord Chesterfield were all contributors.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>That Walpole should also attempt this 'bow of
Ulysses, in which it was the fashion for men
of rank and genius to try their strength,' goes
without saying. His gifts were exactly suited
to the work, and his productions in the new
journal are by no means its worst. His first
essay was a bright little piece of persiflage upon
what he calls the return of nature, and proceeds
to illustrate by the introduction of 'real water'
on the stage, by Kent's landscape gardening,
and by the fauna and flora of the dessert table.
A second effort was devoted to that extraordinary
adventurer, Baron Neuhoff, otherwise
Theodore, King of Corsica, who, with his realm
for his only assets, was at this time a tenant of
the King's Bench prison. Walpole, with genuine
kindness, proposed a subscription for this
bankrupt Belisarius, and a sum of fifty pounds
was collected. This, however, proved so much
below the expectations of His Corsican Majesty
that he actually had the effrontery to threaten
Dodsley, the printer of the paper, with a prosecution
for using his name unjustifiably. 'I
have done with countenancing kings,' wrote
Walpole to Mann.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Others of his <cite>World</cite>
essays are on the Glastonbury Thorn; on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>Letter-Writing,&mdash;a subject of which he might
claim to speak with authority; on old women
as objects of passion; and on politeness, wherein
occurs the already quoted anecdote of
Maclean the highwayman. His light hand and
lighter humour made him an almost ideal contributor
to Moore's pages, and it is not surprising
to find that such judges as Lady Mary
approved his performances, or that he himself
regarded them with a complacency which peeps
out now and again in his letters. 'I met Mrs.
Clive two nights ago,' he says, 'and told her I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>had been in the meadows, but would walk no
more there, for there was all the world. "Well,"
says she, "and don't you like <cite>The World</cite>? I
hear it was very clever last Thursday."' 'Last
Thursday' had appeared Walpole's paper on
elderly 'flames.'</p>

<p>During the period covered by this chapter
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">redintegratio amoris</i> with Gray, to which
reference has been made, became confirmed.
Whether the attachment was ever quite on the
old basis, may be doubted. Gray always poses
a little as the aggrieved person who could not
speak first, and to whom unmistakable overtures
must be made by the other side. He as
yet 'neither repents, nor rejoices over much,
but is pleased,'&mdash;he tells Chute in 1750. On
the other hand, Walpole, though he appears
to have proffered his palm-branch with very
genuine geniality, and desire to let by-gones
be by-gones, was not above very candid criticism
of his recovered friend. 'I agree with
you most absolutely in your opinion about
Gray,' he writes to Montagu in September,
1748: 'he is the worst company in the world.
From a melancholy turn, from living reclusely,
and from a little too much dignity, he never
converses easily; all his words are measured
and chosen, and formed into sentences; his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
writings are admirable; he himself is not agreeable.'
Meantime, however, the revived connection
went on pleasantly. Gray made flying
visits to Strawberry and Arlington Street, and
prattled to Walpole from Pembroke between
whiles. And certainly, in a measure, it is to
Walpole that we owe Gray. It was Walpole
who induced Gray to allow Dodsley to print in
1747, as an attenuated <em>folio</em> pamphlet, the <cite>Ode
on a Distant Prospect of Eton College</cite>; and it
was the tragic end of one of Walpole's favourite
cats in a china tub of gold-fish (of which, by
the way, there was a large pond called Po-yang
at Strawberry) which prompted the delightful
occasional verses by Gray beginning:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">''Twas on a lofty vase's side,</div>
    <div class="verse">Where china's gayest art had dy'd</div>
          <div class="verse indent2">The azure flow'rs that blow;</div>
    <div class="verse">Demurest of the tabby kind,</div>
    <div class="verse">The pensive Selima reclin'd,</div>
          <div class="verse indent2">Gaz'd on the lake below,'&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>a stanza which, with trifling verbal alterations,
long served as a label for the 'lofty vase' in
the Strawberry Hill collection. To Walpole's
officious circulation in manuscript of the famous
<cite>Elegy written in a Country Church-Yard</cite> must
indirectly be attributed its publication by Dodsley
in February, 1751; to Walpole also is due that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
typical piece of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vers de société</i>, the <cite>Long Story</cite>,
which originated in the interest in the recluse
poet of Stoke Poges with which Walpole's well-meaning
(if unwelcome) advocacy had inspired
Lady Cobham and some other lion-hunters of
the neighbourhood. But his chief enterprise
in connection with his friend's productions was
the edition of them put forth in March, 1753,
with illustrations by Richard Bentley, the youngest
child of the famous Master of Trinity.
Bentley possessed considerable attainments as
an amateur artist, and as a scholar and connoisseur
had just that virtuoso <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">finesse</i> of manner
which was most attractive to Walpole, whose
guest and counsellor he frequently became
during the progress of the Strawberry improvements.
Out of this connection, which, in its
hot fits, was of the most confidential character,
grew the suggestion that Bentley should make,
at Walpole's expense, a series of designs for
Gray's poems. These, which are still in existence,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
were engraved with great delicacy by two
of the best engravers of that time, Müller and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>Charles Grignion; and the <cite>Poemata-Grayo-Bentleiana</cite>,
as Walpole christened them, became
and remains one of the most remarkable of the
illustrated books of the last century. Gray, as
may be imagined, could scarcely oppose the
compliment; and he seems to have grown
minutely interested in the enterprise, rewarding
the artist by some commendatory verses, in
which he certainly does not deny himself&mdash;to
use a phrase of Mr. Swinburne&mdash;'the noble
pleasure of praising.'<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> But even over this book
the sensitive ligament that linked him to Walpole
was perilously strained. Without consulting him,
Walpole had his likeness engraved as a frontispiece,&mdash;a
step which instantly drew from Gray
a wail of nervous expostulation so unmistakably
heartfelt that it was impossible to proceed with
the plate. Thus it came about that <cite>Designs by
Mr. R. Bentley for Six Poems by Mr. T. Gray</cite>
made its appearance without the portrait of
the poet.</p>

<p>Bentley's ingenious son was not the only person
whom the decoration of Strawberry pressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>into the service of its owner. Selwyn, the wit,
George James (or 'Gilly') Williams, a connoisseur
of considerable ability, and Richard, second
Lord Edgecumbe, occasionally sat as a committee
of taste,&mdash;a function commemorated by
Reynolds in a conversation-piece which afterwards
formed one of the chief ornaments of the
Refectory;<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and upon Bentley's recommendation
Walpole invited from Jersey a humbler guest
in the person of a German artist named Müntz,&mdash;'an
inoffensive, good creature,' who would
'rather ponder over a foreign gazette than a
palette,' but whose services kept him domiciled
for some time at the Gothic castle. Müntz
executed many views of the neighbourhood,
which are still, like that of Twickenham already
referred to,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> preserved in contemporary engravings.
And besides the persons whom Walpole
drew into his immediate circle, the 'village,'
as he called it, was growing steadily in public
favour. 'Mr. Müntz'&mdash;writes Walpole in
July, 1755&mdash;'says we have more coaches than
there are in half France. Mrs. Pritchard has
bought Ragman's Castle, for which my Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>Litchfield could not agree. We shall be as celebrated
as Baiæ or Tivoli; and if we have not
as sonorous names as they boast, we have very
famous people: Clive and Pritchard, actresses;
Scott and Hudson, painters; my Lady Suffolk,
famous in her time; Mr. H[ickey], the impudent
Lawyer, that Tom Hervey wrote against;
Whitehead, the poet; and Cambridge, the everything.'
Cambridge has already been referred
to as a contributor to <cite>The World</cite>, and the
Whitehead was the one mentioned in Churchill's
stinging couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">'May I (can worse disgrace on manhood fall?)</div>
    <div class="verse">Be born a Whitehead, and baptiz'd a Paul,'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>who then lived on Twickenham Common.
Hickey, a jovial Irish attorney, was the legal
adviser of Burke and Reynolds, and the 'blunt,
pleasant creature' of Goldsmith's 'Retaliation.'
Scott was Samuel Scott, the 'English Canaletto;'
Hudson, Sir Joshua's master, who had
a house on the river near Lord Radnor's. But
Walpole's best allies were two of the other sex.
One was Lady Suffolk, the whilom friend (as
Mrs. Howard) of Pope and Swift and Gay,
whose home at Marble Hill is celebrated in the
Walpole-cum-Pulteney poem; the other was
red-faced Mrs. Clive, who occupied a house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
known familiarly as 'Clive-den,' and officially
as Little Strawberry. She had not yet retired
from the stage. Lady Suffolk's stories of the
Georgian Court and its scandals, and Mrs.
Clive's anecdotes of the green-room, and of their
common neighbour at Hampton, the great
'Roscius' himself (with whom she was always
at war), must have furnished Walpole with an
inexhaustible supply of just the particular description
of gossip which he most appreciated.</p>

<p>In order to take up the little-variegated thread
of Walpole's life, we must again resort to
the <cite>Short Notes</cite>, in which, as already stated, he
has recorded what he considered to be its most
important occurrences. In 1754, he had been
chosen member, in the new Parliament of that
year, for Castle Rising, in Norfolk. In March,
1755, he says, he was very ill-used by his
nephew, Lord Orford [<i>i. e.</i>, the son of his eldest
brother, Robert], upon a contested election in
the House of Commons, 'on which I wrote
him a long letter, with an account of my own
conduct in politics.' This letter does not seem
to have been preserved, and it is difficult to
conceive that its theme could have involved
very lengthy explanations. In February, 1757,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
he vacated his Castle Rising seat for that of
Lynn, and about the same time, he tells us,
used his best endeavours, although in vain, to
save the unfortunate Admiral Byng, who was
executed, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour encourager les autres</i>, in the
following March. But with the exception of
his erection of a tablet to Theodore of Corsica,
and the dismissal, in 1759, of Mr. Müntz, with
whom his connection seems to have been exceptionally
prolonged, his record for the next
decade, or until the publication of the <cite>Castle
of Otranto</cite>, is almost exclusively literary, and
deals with the establishment of his private printing
press at Strawberry Hill, his publication
thereat of Gray's <cite>Odes</cite> and other works, his
<cite>Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors</cite>, his
<cite>Anecdotes of Painting</cite>, and his above-mentioned
romance. This accidental absorption of his
chronicle by literary production will serve as
a sufficient reason for devoting this chapter to
those efforts of his pen which, from the outset,
were destined to the permanence of
type.</p>

<p>Already, as far back as March, 1751, he had
begun the work afterwards known as the
<cite>Memoires of the last Ten Years of the Reign of
George II.</cite>, to the progress of which there are
scattered references in the <cite>Short Notes</cite>. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
had intended at first to confine them to the
history of one year, but they grew under his
hand. His first definite literary effort in 1757,
however, was the clever little squib, after the
model of Montesquieu's <cite>Lettres Persanes</cite>, entitled
<cite>A Letter from Xo Ho, a Chinese Philosopher
at London, to his Friend Lien Chi, at
Peking</cite>, in which he ingeniously satirizes the
'late political revolutions' and the inconstant
disposition of the English nation, not forgetting
to fire off a few sarcasms <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à propos</i> of the Byng
tragedy. The piece, he tells Mann, was written
'in an hour and a half' (there is always a little
of Oronte's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je n'ai demeuré qu'un quart d'heure
à le faire</i> about Walpole's literary efforts), was
sent to press next day, and ran through five
editions in a fortnight.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Mrs. Clive was of
opinion that the rash satirist would be sent to
the Tower; but he himself regarded it as 'perhaps
the only political paper ever written, in
which no man of any party could dislike or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>deny a single fact;' and Henry Fox, to whom
he sent a copy, may be held to confirm this
view, since his only objection seems to have
been that it did not hit some of the <em>other</em> side
a little harder. It would be difficult now without
long notes to make it intelligible to modern
readers; but the following outburst of the
Chinese philosopher respecting the variations
of the English climate has the merit of enduring
applicability. 'The English have no sun, no
summer, as we have, at least their sun does not
scorch like ours. They content themselves
with names: at a certain time of the year they
leave their capital, and that makes summer;
they go out of the city, and that makes the
country. Their monarch, when he goes into
the country, passes in his calash<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> by a row of
high trees, goes along a gravel walk, crosses
one of the chief streets, is driven by the side
of a canal between two rows of lamps, at the
end of which he has a small house [Kensington
Palace], and then he is supposed to be in the
country. I saw this ceremony yesterday: as
soon as he was gone the men put on under vest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>ments
of white linen, and the women left off
those vast draperies, which they call <em>hoops</em>, and
which I have described to thee; and then all the
men and all the women said <em>it was hot</em>. If thou
wilt believe me, I am now [in May] writing to
thee before a fire.'<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>In the following June Walpole had betaken
himself to the place he 'loved best of all,' and
was amusing himself at Strawberry with his pen.
The next work which he records is the publication
of a Catalogue of the Collection of
Pictures, etc., of [<i>i. e.</i>, belonging to] Charles
the First, for which he prepared 'a little introduction.'
This, and the subsequent 'prefaces
or advertisements' to the Catalogues of the
Collections of James the Second, and the Duke
of Buckingham, are to be found in vol. i., pp.
234-41, of his works. But the great event of
1757 is the establishment of the <cite>Officina Arbuteana</cite>,
or private printing press, of Strawberry
Hill. 'Elzevir, Aldus, and Stephens,' he tells
Chute in July, 'are the freshest personages in
his memory,' and he jestingly threatens to assume
as his motto (with a slight variation) Pope's
couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">'Some have at first for wits, then poets pass'd;</div>
    <div class="verse">Turn'd <em>printers</em> next, and proved plain fools at last.'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>
<p>'I am turned printer,' he writes somewhat
later, 'and have converted a little cottage into
a printing-office. My abbey is a perfect college
or academy. I keep a painter [Müntz] in the
house, and a printer,&mdash;not to mention Mr.
Bentley, who is an academy himself.' William
Robinson, the printer, an Irishman with noticeable
eyes which Garrick envied ('they are more
Richard the Third's than Garrick's own,' says
Walpole), must have been a rather original personage,
to judge by a copy of one of his letters
which his patron incloses to Mann. He says
he found it in a drawer where it had evidently
been placed to attract his attention. After
telling his correspondent in bad blank verse
that he dates from the 'shady bowers, nodding
groves, and amaranthine shades (?)' of Twickenham,&mdash;'Richmond's
near neighbour, where great
George the King resides,'&mdash;Robinson proceeds
to describe his employer as 'the Hon. Horatio
Walpole, son to the late great Sir Robert Walpole,
who is very studious, and an admirer of
all the liberal arts and sciences; amongst the
rest he admires printing. He has fitted out a
complete printing-house at this his country seat,
and has done me the favour to make me sole
manager and operator (there being no one but
myself). All men of genius resorts his house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
courts his company, and admires his understanding:
what with his own and their writings, I
believe I shall be pretty well employed. I have
pleased him, and I hope to continue so to do.'
Then, after reference to the extreme heat,&mdash;a
heat by which fowls and quarters of lamb have
been roasted in the London Artillery grounds
'by the help of glasses,' so capricious was
the climate over which Walpole had made merry
in May,&mdash;he proceeds to describe Strawberry.
'The place I am now in is all my comfort from
the heat; the situation of it is close to the
Thames, and is Richmond Gardens (if you were
ever in them) in miniature, surrounded by
bowers, groves, cascades, and ponds, and on
a rising ground not very common in this part
of the country; the building elegant, and the
furniture of a peculiar taste, magnificent and
superb.' At this date poor Robinson seems to
have been delighted with the place and the
fastidious master whom he hoped 'to continue
to please.' But Walpole was nothing if not
mutable, and two years later he had found out
that Robinson of the remarkable eyes was 'a
foolish Irishman who took himself for a genius,'
and they parted, with the result that the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Officina
Arbuteana</i> was temporarily at a standstill.</p>

<p>For the moment, however, things went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
smoothly enough. It had been intended that
the maiden effort of the Strawberry types
should have been a translation by Bentley of
Paul Hentzner's curious account of England in
1598. But Walpole suddenly became aware
that Gray had put the penultimate, if not the
final, touches to his painfully elaborated Pindaric
Odes, the <cite>Bard</cite> and the <cite>Progress of Poesy</cite>,
and he pounced upon them forthwith; Gray, as
usual, half expostulating, half overborne. 'You
will dislike this as much as I do,'&mdash;he writes to
Mason,&mdash;'but there is no help.' 'You understand,'
he adds, with the air of one resigning
himself to the inevitable, 'it is he that prints
them, not for me, but for Dodsley.' However,
he persisted in refusing Walpole's not entirely
unreasonable request for notes. 'If a thing
cannot be understood without them,' he said
characteristically, 'it had better not be understood
at all.' Consequently, while describing
them as 'Greek, Pindaric, sublime,' Walpole
confesses under his breath that they are a little
obscure. Dodsley paid Gray forty guineas for
the book, which was a large, thin quarto, entitled
<cite>Odes by Mr. Gray; Printed, at Strawberry
Hill, for R. and J. Dodsley in Pall-Mall</cite>. It
was published in August, and the price was a
shilling. On the title-page was a vignette of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the Gothic castle at Twickenham. From a letter
of Walpole to Lyttelton it would seem that his
apprehensions as to the poems being 'understanded
of the people' proved well founded.
'They [the age] have cast their eyes over them,
found them obscure, and looked no further; yet
perhaps no compositions ever had more sublime
beauties than are in each,'&mdash;and he goes on to
criticise them minutely in a fashion which shows
that his own appreciation of them was by no
means unqualified. But Warburton and Garrick
and the 'word-picker' Hurd were enthusiastic.
Lyttelton and Shenstone followed more
moderately. Upon the whole, the success of
the first venture was encouraging, and the share
in it of 'Elzevir Horace,' as Conway called his
friend, was not forgotten.</p>

<p>Gray's <cite>Odes</cite> were succeeded by Hentzner's
<cite>Travels</cite>, or, to speak more accurately, by that
portion of Hentzner's <cite>Travels</cite> which refers
to England. In England Hentzner was little
known, and the 220 copies which Walpole printed
in October, 1757, were prefaced by an Advertisement
from his pen, and a dedication to the
Society of Antiquaries, of which he was a
member. After this came, in 1758, his <cite>Catalogue
of Royal and Noble Authors</cite>; a collection
of <cite>Fugitive Pieces</cite> (which included his essays in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the <cite>World</cite>), dedicated to Conway;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and seven
hundred copies of Lord Whitworth's <cite>Account
of Russia</cite>. Then followed a book by Joseph
Spence, <cite>the Parallel of Magliabecchi and Mr.</cite>
[Robert] <cite>Hill</cite>, a learned tailor of Buckingham,
the object of which was to benefit Hill,&mdash;an end
which must have been attained, as six out of
seven hundred copies were sold in a fortnight,
and the book was reprinted in London. Bentley's
<cite>Lucan</cite>, a quarto of five hundred copies,
succeeded Spence, and then came three other
quartos of <cite>Anecdotes of Painting</cite>, by Walpole
himself. The only other notable products of
the press during this period are the Autobiography
of Lord Herbert of Cherbury, quarto,
1764, and one hundred copies of the <cite>Poems</cite> of
Lady Temple. This, however, is a very fair
record for seven years' work, when it is remembered
that the Strawberry Hill staff never
exceeded a man and a boy. As already stated,
the first printer, Robinson, was dismissed in
1759. His place, after a short interval of 'occasional
hands,' was taken by Thomas Kirgate,
whose name thenceforth appears on all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>Twickenham issues, with which it is indissolubly
connected. Kirgate continued, with
greater good fortune than his predecessors, to
perform his duties until Walpole's death.</p>

<p>In the above list there are two volumes
which, in these pages, deserve a more extended
notice than the rest. <cite>The Catalague of Royal
and Noble Authors</cite> had at least the merit of
novelty, and certainly a better reason for existing
than some of the works to which its author
refers in his preface. Even the performances
of Pulteney, Earl of Bath, and the English
rondeaus of Charles of Orleans are more
worthy of a chronicler than the lives of
physicians who had been poets, of men who
had died laughing, or of Frenchmen who had
studied Hebrew. Walpole took considerable
pains in obtaining information, and his book
was exceedingly well received,&mdash;indeed, far
more favourably than he had any reason to
expect. A second edition, which was not
printed at Strawberry Hill, speedily followed
the first, with no diminution of its prosperity.
For an effort which made no pretensions to
symmetry, which is often meagre where it
might have been expected to be full, and is
everywhere prejudiced by a sort of fine-gentleman
disdain of exactitude, this was cer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>tainly
as much as he could anticipate. But
he seems to have been more than usually
sensitive to criticism, and some of the amplest
of his <cite>Short Notes</cite> are devoted to the discussion
of the adverse opinions which were
expressed. From these we learn that he was
abused by the <cite>Critical Review</cite> for disliking
the Stuarts, and by the <cite>Monthly</cite> for liking
his father. Further, that he found an apologist
in Dr. Hill (of the <cite>Inspector</cite>), whose gross
adulation was worse than abuse; and lastly,
that he was seriously attacked in a Pamphlet
of <cite>Remarks on Mr. Walpole's 'Catalogue of
Royal and Noble Authors'</cite> by a certain Carter,
concerning whose antecedents his irritation
goes on to bring together all the scandals he
can collect. As the <cite>Short Notes</cite> were written
long after the events, it shows how his soreness
against his critics continued. What it was
when still fresh may be gathered from the following
quotation from a letter to Rev. Henry
Zouch, to whom he was indebted for many
new facts and corrections, especially in the
second edition, and who afterwards helped
him in the <cite>Anecdotes of Painting</cite>: 'I am sick
of the character of author; I am sick of the
consequences of it; I am weary of seeing my
name in the newspapers; I am tired with read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>ing
foolish criticisms on me, and as foolish
defences of me; and I trust my friends will
be so good as to let the last abuse of me pass
unanswered. It is called "Remarks" on my
Catalogue, asperses the Revolution more than
it does my book, and, in one word, is written
by a non-juring preacher, who was a dog-doctor.
Of me, he knows so little that he thinks to
punish me by abusing King William!'<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>In a letter of a few months earlier to the
same correspondent, he refers to another task,
upon which, in despite of the sentence just
quoted, he continued to employ himself. 'Last
summer'&mdash;he says&mdash;'I bought of Vertue's
widow forty volumes of his MS. collections
relating to English painters, sculptors, gravers,
and architects. He had actually begun their
lives: unluckily he had not gone far, and could
not write grammar. I propose to digest and
complete this work.'<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The purchases referred
to had been made subsequent to 1756, when
Mrs. Vertue applied to Walpole, as a connoisseur,
to buy from her the voluminous notes and
memoranda which her husband had accumulated
with respect to art and artists in England.
Walpole also acquired at Vertue's sale in May,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>1757, a number of copies from Holbein and
two or three other pictures. He seems to have
almost immediately set about arranging and
digesting this unwieldy and chaotic heap of
material,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> much of which, besides being illiterate,
was also illegible. More than once his
patience gave way under the drudgery; but
he nevertheless persevered in a way that shows
a tenacity of purpose foreign, in this case at all
events, to his assumption of dilettante indifference.
His progress is thus chronicled. He
began in January, 1760, and finished the first
volume on 14 August. The second volume was
begun in September, and completed on the 23rd
October. On the 4th January in the following
year he set about the third volume, but laid it
aside after the first day, not resuming it until
the end of June. In August, however, he
finished it. Two volumes were published in
1762, and a third, which is dated 1763, in 1764.
As usual, he affected more or less to undervalue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>his own share in the work; but he very justly
laid stress in his 'Preface' upon the fact that
he was little more than the arranger of data
not collected by his own exertions. 'I would
not,' he said to Zouch, 'have the materials of
forty years, which was Vertue's case, depreciated
in compliment to the work of four months,
which is almost my whole merit.' Here, again,
the tone is a little in the Oronte manner; but,
upon the main point, the interest of the work,
his friends did not share his apprehensions, and
Gray especially was 'violent about it.' Nor
did the public show themselves less appreciative,
for there was so much that was new in the dead
engraver's memoranda, and so much which was
derived from private galleries or drawn from
obscure sources, that the work could scarcely
have failed of readers even if the style had been
hopelessly corrupt, which, under Walpole's
revision, it certainly was not. In 1762, he
began a <cite>Catalogue of Engravers</cite>, which he
finished in about six weeks as a supplementary
volume, and in 1765, still from the Strawberry
Press, he issued a second edition of the
whole.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>After the appearance of the second edition
of the <cite>Anecdotes of Painting</cite>, a silence fell upon
the <cite>Officina Arbuteana</cite> for three years, during
the earlier part of which time Walpole was at
Paris, as will be narrated in the next chapter.
His press, as may be guessed, was one of the
sights of his Gothic castle, and there are several
anecdotes showing how his ingenious fancy
made it the vehicle of adroit compliment.
Once, not long after it had been established,
my Lady Rochford, Lady Townshend (the
witty Ethelreda, or Audrey, Harrison),<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and Sir
John Bland's sister were carried after dinner
into the printing-room to see Mr. Robinson at
work. He immediately struck off some verse
which was already in type, and presented it to
Lady Townshend:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Press speaks</span>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">From me wits and poets their glory obtain;</div>
    <div class="verse">Without me their wit and their verses were vain.</div>
    <div class="verse">Stop, Townshend, and let me but paint<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> what you say,</div>
    <div class="verse">You, the fame I on others bestow, will repay.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>The visitors then asked, as had been anticipated
to see the actual process of setting up;
and Walpole ostensibly gave the printer four
lines out of Rowe's <cite>Fair Penitent</cite>. But, by
what would now be styled a clever feat of prestidigitation,
the forewarned Robinson struck off
the following, this time to Lady Rochford:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Press speaks.</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">In vain from your properest name you have flown,</div>
    <div class="verse">And exchanged lovely Cupid's for Hymen's dull throne;</div>
    <div class="verse">By my art shall your beauties be constantly sung,</div>
    <div class="verse">And in spite of yourself, you shall ever be <em>young</em>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Lady Rochford's maiden name, it should be
explained, was 'Young.' Such were what their
inventor call <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les amusements des eaux de Straberri</i>
in the month of August and the year of
grace 1757.</p>

<p>Beyond the major efforts already mentioned,
the <cite>Short Notes</cite> contain references to various
fugitive pieces which Walpole composed, some
of which he printed, and some others of which
have been published since his death. One of
these, <cite>The Magpie and her Brood</cite>, was a pleasant
little fable from the French of Bonaventure
des Periers, rhymed for Miss Hotham, the
youthful niece of his neighbour Lady Suffolk;
another, a <cite>Dialogue between two Great Ladies</cite>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
In 1761, he wrote a poem on the King, entitled
<cite>The Garland</cite>, which first saw the light in the
<cite>Quarterly</cite> for 1852 [No. <span class="smcap">CLXXX.</span>]. Besides
these were several epigrams, mock sermons,
and occasional verses. But perhaps the most
interesting of his productions in this kind are
the octosyllabics which he wrote in August,
1759, and called <cite>The Parish Register of
Twickenham</cite>. This is a metrical list of all
the remarkable persons who ever lived there,
for which reason a portion of it may find a place
in these pages:&mdash;</p>

<p>In 1784, Walpole added a few lines to celebrate
a new resident and a new favourite, Lady
Di. Beauclerk, the widow of Johnson's famous
friend.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Most of the other names which occur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>in the <cite>Twickenham Register</cite> are easily identified.
'Fanny, "ever-blooming fair,"' was the
beautiful Lady Fanny Shirley of Phillips' ballad
and Pope's epistle, aunt of that fourth Earl
Ferrers who in 1760 was hanged at Tyburn
for murdering his steward. Miss Hawkins
remembered her as residing at a house now
called Heath Lane Lodge, with her mother,
'a very ancient Countess Ferrers,' widow of
the first Earl. Henry Fielding, to whom Walpole
gives a quatrain, the second couplet of
which must excuse the insolence of the first,
had for some time lodgings in Back Lane,
whence was baptised in February, 1748, the
elder of his sons by his second wife, the
William Fielding who, like his father, became
a Westminster magistrate. It is more likely
that <cite>Tom Jones</cite> was written at Twickenham
than at any of the dozen other places for which
that honour is claimed, since the author quitted
Twickenham late in 1748, and his great novel
was published early in the following year.
Walpole had only been resident for a short time
when Fielding left, but even had this been
otherwise, it is not likely that, between the
master of the Comic Epos (who was also Lady
Mary's cousin!) and the dilettante proprietor
of Strawberry, there could ever have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
much cordiality. Indeed, for some of the
robuster spirits of his age Walpole shows an
extraordinary distaste, which with him generally
implies unsympathetic, if not absolutely
illiberal, comment. Almost the only important
anecdote of Fielding in his correspondence is
one of which the distorting bias is demonstrable;<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
and to Fielding's contemporary, Hogarth,
although as a connoisseur he was shrewd
enough to collect his works, he scarcely ever
refers but to place him in a ridiculous aspect,&mdash;a
course which contrasts curiously with the
extravagant praise he gives to Bentley, Bunbury,
Lady Di. Beauclerk, and some other of the
very minor artistic lights in his own circle.</p>

<p>It is, however, possible to write too long an
excursus upon the <cite>Twickenham Parish Register</cite>,
and the last paragraphs of this chapter belong
of right to another and more important work,&mdash;<cite>The
Castle of Otranto</cite>. According to the
<cite>Short Notes</cite>, this 'Gothic romance' was begun
in June, 1764, and finished on the 6th August
following. From another account we learn that
it occupied eight nights of this period from ten
o'clock at night until two in the morning, to the
accompaniment of coffee. In a letter to Cole,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>the Cambridge antiquary, with whom Walpole
commenced to correspond in 1762, he gives some
further particulars, which, because they have
been so often quoted, can scarcely be omitted
here: 'Shall I even confess to you what was
the origin of this romance? I waked one
morning, in the beginning of last June, from a
dream, of which all I could recover was, that I
had thought myself in an ancient castle (a very
natural dream for a head filled, like mine, with
Gothic story), and that on the uppermost bannister
of a great staircase I saw a gigantic hand
in armour. In the evening I sat down and
began to write, without knowing in the least
what I intended to say or relate. The work
grew on my hands, and I grew fond of it,&mdash;add
that I was very glad to think of anything, rather
than politics. In short, I was so engrossed
with my tale, which I completed in less than
two months, that one evening I wrote from the
time I had drunk my tea, about six o'clock, till
half an hour after one in the morning, when my
hand and fingers were so weary that I could not
hold the pen to finish the sentence, but left
Matilda and Isabella talking, in the middle of a
paragraph.'<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>The work of which the origin is thus de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>scribed
was published in a limited edition on
the 24th December, 1764, with the title of <cite>The
Castle of Otranto, a Story, translated by William
Marshal, Gent., from the original Italian of Onuphrio
Muralto, Canon of the Church of St.
Nicholas at Otranto</cite>. The name of the alleged
Italian author is sometimes described as an anagram
from Horace Walpole,&mdash;a misconception
which is easily demonstrated by counting the
letters. The book was printed, not for Walpole,
but for Lownds, of Fleet Street, and it was
prefaced by an introduction in which the author
described and criticised the supposed original,
which he declared to be a black-letter printed
at Naples in 1529. Its success was considerable.
It seems at first to have excited no suspicion
as to its authenticity, and it is not clear
that even Gray, to whom a copy was sent immediately
after publication, was in the secret.
'I have received the <cite>Castle of Otranto</cite>,' he
says, 'and return you my thanks for it. It engages
our attention here [at Cambridge], makes
some of us cry a little, and all in general afraid
to go to bed o' nights.' In the second edition,
which followed in April, 1765, Walpole dropped
the mask, disclosing his authorship in a second
preface of great ability, which, among other
things, contains a vindication of Shakespeare's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
mingling of comedy and tragedy against the
strictures of Voltaire,&mdash;a piece of temerity
which some of his French friends feared might
prejudice him with that formidable critic. But
what is even more interesting is his own account
of what he had attempted. He had endeavoured
to blend ancient and modern romance,&mdash;to employ
the old supernatural agencies of Scudéry
and La Calprenède as the background to the
adventures of personages modelled as closely
upon ordinary life as the personages of <cite>Tom
Jones</cite>. These are not his actual illustrations,
but they express his meaning. 'The actions,
sentiments, conversations, of the heroes and
heroines of ancient days were as unnatural as
the machines employed to put them in motion.'
He would make his heroes and heroines natural
in all these things, only borrowing from the
older school some of that imagination, invention,
and fancy which, in the literal reproduction of
life, he thought too much neglected.</p>

<p>His idea was novel, and the moment a favourable
one for its development. Fluently and
lucidly written, the <cite>Castle of Otranto</cite> set a
fashion in literature. But, like many other
works produced under similar conditions, it had
its day. To the pioneer of a movement which
has exhausted itself, there comes often what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
almost worse than oblivion,&mdash;discredit and
neglect. A generation like the present, for
whom fiction has unravelled so many intricate
combinations, and whose Gothicism and Mediævalism
are better instructed than Walpole's, no
longer feels its soul harrowed up in the same
way as did his hushed and awe-struck readers
of the days of the third George. To the critic
the book is interesting as the first of a school of
romances which had the honour of influencing
even the mighty 'Wizard of the North,' who,
no doubt in gratitude, wrote for <cite>Ballantyne's
Novelist's Library</cite> a most appreciative study of
the story. But we doubt if that many-plumed
and monstrous helmet, which crashes through
stone walls and cellars, could now give a single
shiver to the most timorous Cambridge don,
while we suspect that the majority of modern
students would, like the author, leave Matilda
and Isabella talking, in the middle of a paragraph,
but from a different kind of weariness.

<p>When, towards the close of 1765,
Walpole made the first of several
visits to Paris, the society of the French capital,
and indeed French society as a whole, was
showing signs of that coming <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">culbute générale</i>
which was not to be long deferred. The upper
classes were shamelessly immoral, and, from the
King downwards, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liaisons</i> of the most open
character excited neither censure nor comment.
It was the era of Voltaire and the Encyclopædists;
it was the era of Rousseau and the Sentimentalists;
it was also the era of confirmed
Anglomania. While we, on our side, were beginning
to copy the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comédies larmoyantes</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
La Chaussée and Diderot, the French in their
turn were acting <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>, and raving
over Richardson. Richardson's chief rival in
their eyes was Hume, then a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chargé d'affaires</i>,
and, in spite of his plain face and bad French,
the idol of the freethinkers. He 'is treated
here,' writes Walpole, 'with perfect veneration;'
and we learn from other sources that no
lady's toilette was complete without his attendance.
'At the Opera,'&mdash;says Lord Charlemont,&mdash;'his
broad, unmeaning face was usually seen
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entre deux jolis minois</i>; the ladies in France
gave the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ton</i>, and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ton</i> was Deism.' Apart
from literature, irreligion, and philosophy, the
chief occupation was cards. 'Whisk and
Richardson' is Walpole's later definition of
French society; 'Whisk and disputes,' that of
Hume. According to Walpole, a kind of pedantry
and solemnity was the characteristic of
conversation, and 'laughing was as much out
of fashion as pantins or bilboquets. Good folks,
they have no time to laugh. There is God and
the King to be pulled down first; and men and
women, one and all, are devoutly employed in
the demolition.' How that enterprise eventuated,
history has recorded.</p>

<p>It is needless, however, to rehearse the origins
of the French Revolution, in order to make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
background for the visit of an English gentleman
to Paris in 1765. Walpole had been meditating
this journey for two or three years; but
the state of his health, among other things (he
suffered much from gout), had from time to time
postponed it. In 1763, he had been going
next spring;<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> but when next spring came he
talked of the beginning of 1765. Nevertheless,
in March of that year, Gilly Williams writes to
Selwyn: 'Horry Walpole has now postponed
his journey till May,' and then he goes on to
speak of the <cite>Castle of Otranto</cite> in a way which
shows that all the author's friends were not
equally enthusiastic respecting that ingenious
romance. 'How do you think he has employed
that leisure which his political frenzy has allowed
of? In writing a novel, ... and such
a novel that no boarding-school miss of thirteen
could get through without yawning. It consists
of ghosts and enchantments; pictures walk out
of their frames, and are good company for half
an hour together; helmets drop from the moon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>and cover half a family. He says it was a
dream, and I fancy one when he had some
feverish disposition in him.'<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> May, however,
had arrived and passed, and the <cite>Castle of
Otranto</cite> was in its second edition, before
Walpole at last set out, on Monday, the 9th
September, 1765. After a seven hours' passage,
he reached Calais from Dover. Near Amiens
he was refreshed by a sight of one of his favourites,
Lady Mary Coke,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> 'in pea-green and
silver;' at Chantilly he was robbed of his port<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>manteau.
By the time he reached Paris, on the
13th, he had already 'fallen in love with twenty
things, and in hate with forty.' The dirt of
Paris, the narrowness of the streets, the 'trees
clipped to resemble brooms, and planted on
pedestals of chalk,' disgust him. But he is
enraptured with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">treillage</i> and fountains,
'and will prove it at Strawberry.' He detests
the French opera, though he loves the French
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">opéra-comique</i>, with its Italian comedy and his
passion,&mdash;'his dear favourite harlequin.' Upon
the whole, in these first impressions he is disappointed.
Society is duller than he expected,
and with the staple topics of its conversation,&mdash;philosophy,
literature, and freethinking,&mdash;he is
(or says he is) out of sympathy. 'Freethinking
is for one's self, surely not for society.... I
dined to-day with half-a-dozen <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savans</i>, and though
all the servants were waiting, the conversation
was much more unrestrained, even on the
Old Testament, than I would suffer at my own
table in England if a single footman was present.
For literature, it is very amusing when
one has nothing else to do. I think it rather
pedantic in society; tiresome when displayed
professedly; and, besides, in this country one is
sure it is only the fashion of the day.' And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
then he goes on to say that the reigning fashion
is Richardson and Hume.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>One of his earliest experiences was his presentation
at Versailles to the royal family,&mdash;a
ceremony which luckily involved but one operation
instead of several, as in England, where the
Princess Dowager of Wales, the Duke of Cumberland,
and the Princess Amelia had all their
different levees. He gives an account of this
to Lady Hervey; but repeats it on the same
day with much greater detail in a letter to
Chute. 'You perceive [he says] that I have
been presented. The Queen took great notice
of me [for which reason, in imitation of Madame
de Sévigné, he tells Lady Hervey that she is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le
plus grand roi du monde</i>]; none of the rest said
a syllable. You are let into the King's bedchamber
just as he has put on his shirt; he
dresses, and talks good-humouredly to a few,
glares at strangers, goes to mass, to dinner, and
a-hunting. The good old Queen, who is like
Lady Primrose in the face, and Queen Caroline
in the immensity of her cap, is at her dressing-table,
attended by two or three old ladies....
Thence you go to the Dauphin, for all is done in
an hour. He scarce stays a minute; indeed,
poor creature, he is a ghost, and cannot possibly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>last three months. [He died, in fact, within
this time, on the 20th December.] The
Dauphiness is in her bed-chamber, but dressed
and standing; looks cross, is not civil, and has
the true Westphalian grace and accents. The
four Mesdames [these were the <cite>Graille</cite>, <cite>Chiffe</cite>,
<cite>Coche</cite>, and <cite>Loque</cite> of history], who are clumsy,
plump old wenches, with a bad likeness to their
father, stand in a bedchamber in a row, with
black cloaks and knotting-bags, looking good-humoured,
[and] not knowing what to say....
This ceremony is very short; then you are carried
to the Dauphin's three boys, who, you may be
sure, only bow and stare. The Duke of Berry
[afterwards Louis XVI.] looks weak and weak-eyed;
the Count de Provence [Louis XVIII.]
is a fine boy; the Count d'Artois [Charles X.]
well enough. The whole concludes with seeing
the Dauphin's little girl dine, who is as round and
as fat as a pudding.'<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Such is Walpole's account
of the royal family of France on exhibition. In
the Queen's ante-chamber he was treated to a
sight of the famous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bête du Gévaudan</i>, a hugeous
wolf, of which a highly sensational representation
had been given in the <cite>St. James's Chronicle</cite>
for June 6-8. It had just been shot, after a
prosperous but nefarious career, and was ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>hibited
by two chasseurs 'with as much parade
as if it was Mr. Pitt.'<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>When he had been at Paris little less than a
month, he was laid up with the gout in both
feet. He was visited during his illness by
Wilkes, for whom he expresses no admiration.
From another letter it appears that Sterne and
Foote were also staying in the French capital
at this time. In November he is still limping
about, and it is evident that confinement in 'a
bedchamber in a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hôtel garni</i>, ... when the
court is at Fontainebleau,' has not been without
its effect upon his views of things in general.
In writing to Gray (who replies with all sorts
of kindly remedies), he says, 'The charms of
Paris have not the least attraction for me, nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>would keep me an hour on their own account.
For the city itself, I cannot conceive where my
eyes were: it is the ugliest, beastliest town in
the universe. I have not seen a mouthful of
verdure out of it, nor have they anything green
but their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">treillage</i> and window shutters....
Their boasted knowledge of society is reduced
to talking of their suppers, and every malady
they have about them, or know of.' A day or
two later his gout and his stick have left him,
and his good humour is coming back. Before
the month ends, he is growing reconciled to his
environment; and by January 'France is so
agreeable, and England so much the reverse,'&mdash;he
tells Lady Hervey,&mdash;'that he does not know
when he shall return.' The great ladies, too,
Madame de Brionne, Madame d'Aiguillon,
Marshal Richelieu's daughter, Madame d'Egmont
(with whom he could fall in love if it
would break anybody's heart in England), begin
to flatter and caress him. His 'last new passion'
is the Duchess de Choiseul, who is so
charming that 'you would take her for the
queen of an allegory.' 'One dreads its finishing,
as much as a lover, if she would admit one,
would wish it should finish.' There is also a
beautiful Countess de Forcalquier, the 'broken
music' of whose imperfect English stirs him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
into heroics too Arcadian for the matter-of-fact
meridian of London, where Lady Hervey is
cautioned not to exhibit them to the profane.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>In a letter of later date to Gray, he describes
some more of these graceful and witty leaders
of fashion, whose '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douceur</i>' he seems to have
greatly preferred to the pompous and arrogant
fatuity of the men. 'They have taken up
gravity,'&mdash;he says of these latter,&mdash;'thinking
it was philosophy and English, and so have
acquired nothing in the room of their natural
levity and cheerfulness.' But with the women
the case is different. He knows six or seven
'with very superior understandings; some of
them with wit, or with softness, or very good
sense.' His first portrait is of the famous
Madame Geoffrin, to whom he had been
recommended by Lady Hervey, and who had
visited him when imprisoned in his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chambre
garni</i>. He lays stress upon her knowledge of
character, her tact and good sense, and the
happy mingling of freedom and severity by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>which she preserved her position as 'an epitome
of empire, subsisting by rewards and
punishments.' Then there is the Maréchale
de Mirepoix, a courtier and an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">intrigante</i> of the
first order. 'She is false, artful, and insinuating
beyond measure when it is her interest,
but indolent and a coward,' says Walpole,
who does not measure his words even when
speaking of a beauty and a Princess of Lorraine.
Others are the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savante</i>, Madame de Boufflers,
who visited England and Johnson, and whom
the writer hits off neatly by saying that you
would think she was always sitting for her
picture to her biographer; a second <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savante</i>,
Madame de Rochfort, 'the <em>decent</em> friend' of
Walpole's former guest at Strawberry, the Duc
de Nivernais;<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> the already mentioned Duchess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>de Choiseul, and Madame la Maréchale de
Luxembourg, whose youth had been stormy,
but who was now softening down into a kind
of twilight melancholy which made her rather
attractive. This last, with one exception, completes
his list.</p>

<p>The one exception is a figure which henceforth
played no inconsiderable part in Walpole's
correspondence,&mdash;that of the brilliant
and witty Madame du Deffand. As Marie de
Vichy-Chamrond, she had been married at
one-and-twenty to the nobleman whose name
she bore, and had followed the custom of her
day by speedily choosing a lover, who had
many successors. For a brief space she had
captivated the Regent himself, and at this date,
being nearly seventy and hopelessly blind, was
continuing, from mere force of habit, a 'decent
friendship' with the deaf President Hénault.
At first Walpole was not impressed with her,
and speaks of her, disrespectfully, as 'an old
blind debauchee of wit.' A little later, although
he still refers to her as the 'old lady of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>house,' he says she is very agreeable. Later
still, she has completed her conquest by telling
him he has <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le fou mocquer</i>; and in the letter to
Gray above quoted, it is plain that she has
become an object of absorbing interest to him,
not unmingled with a nervous apprehension of
her undisguised partiality for his society. In
spite of her affliction (he says) she 'retains all
her vivacity, wit, memory, judgment, passions,
and agreeableness. She goes to Operas, Plays,
suppers, and Versailles; gives suppers twice
a week; has every thing new read to her;
makes new songs and epigrams, ay, admirably,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
and remembers every one that has been made
these fourscore years. She corresponds with
Voltaire, dictates charming letters to him, contradicts
him, is no bigot to him or anybody,
and laughs both at the clergy and the philosophers.
In a dispute, into which she easily falls,
she is very warm, and yet scarce ever in the
wrong; her judgment on every subject is as
just as possible; on every point of conduct as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>wrong as possible: for she is all love and
hatred, passionate for her friends to enthusiasm,
still anxious to be loved, I don't mean
by lovers, and a vehement enemy, but openly.
As she can have no amusement but conversation,
the least solitude and ennui are insupportable
to her, and put her into the power
of several worthless people, who eat her suppers
when they can eat nobody's of higher rank;
wink to one another and laugh at her; hate
her because she has forty times more parts,
and venture to hate her because she is not
rich.'<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> In another letter, to Mr. James Crawford
of Auchinames (Hume's <cite>Fish</cite> Crawford),
who was also one of Madame du Deffand's
admirers, he says, in repeating some of the
above details, that he is not 'ashamed of interesting
himself exceedingly about her. To
say nothing of her extraordinary parts, she is
certainly the most generous, friendly being upon
earth.' Upon her side, Madame du Deffand
seems to have been equally attracted by the
strange mixture of independence and effeminacy
which went to make up Walpole's character.
Her attachment to him rapidly grew into a
kind of infatuation. He had no sooner quitted
Paris, which he did on the 17th April, than she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>began to correspond with him; and thenceforward,
until her death in 1780, her letters,
dictated to her faithful secretary, Wiart, continued,
except when Walpole was actually visiting
her (and she sometimes wrote to him even
then), to reach him regularly. Not long after
his return to England, she made him the victim
of a charming hoax. He had, when in Paris,
admired a snuff-box which bore a portrait of
Madame de Sévigné, for whom he professed an
extravagant admiration. Madame du Deffand
procured a similar box, had the portrait copied,
and sent it to him with a letter, purporting to
come from the dateless Elysian Fields and
'Notre Dame de Livry' herself, in which he
was enjoined to use his present always, and
to bring it often to France and the Faubourg
St. Germain. Walpole was completely taken
in, and imagined that the box had come from
Madame de Choiseul; but he should have
known at first that no one living but his blind
friend could have written 'that most charming
of all letters.' The box itself, the memento of
so much old-world ingenuity, was sold (with the
pseudo-Sévigné epistle) at the Strawberry Hill
sale for £28 7<i>s.</i> When witty Mrs. Clive heard
of the last addition to Walpole's list of favourites,
she delivered herself of a good-humoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon mot</i>. There was a new resident at Twickenham,&mdash;the
first Earl of Shelburne's widow.
'If the new Countess is but lame,' quoth Clive
(referring to the fact that Lady Suffolk was deaf,
and Madame du Deffand blind), 'I shall have
no chance of ever seeing you.' But there is
nothing to show that he ever relaxed in his
attentions to the delightful actress, whom he
somewhere styles <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dimidium animæ meæ</i>.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>One of the other illustrious visitors to Paris
during Walpole's stay there was Rousseau. Being
no longer safe in his Swiss asylum, where
the curate of Motiers had excited the mob
against him, that extraordinary self-tormentor,
clad in his Armenian costume, had arrived in
December at the French capital, and shortly
afterwards left for England, under the safe-conduct
of Hume, who had undertaken to procure
him a fresh resting-place. He reached London
on the 14th January, 1766. Walpole had, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>use his own phrase, 'a hearty contempt' for the
fugitive sentimentalist and his grievances; and
not long before Rousseau's advent in Paris,
taking for his pretext an offer made by the King
of Prussia, he had woven some of the light
mockery at Madame Geoffrin's into a sham letter
from Frederick to Jean-Jacques, couched in the
true Walpolean spirit of persiflage. It is difficult
to summarize, and may be reproduced here as its
author transcribed it on the 12th January, for
the benefit of Conway:&mdash;</p>

<p>This composition, the French of which was
touched up by Helvétius, Hénault, and the Duc
de Nivernais, gave extreme satisfaction to all
the anti-Rousseau party.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> While Hume and
his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</i> were still in Paris, Walpole, out of
delicacy to Hume, managed to keep the matter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>a secret; and he also abstained from making any
overtures to Rousseau, whom, as he truly said,
he could scarcely have visited cordially, with a
letter in his pocket written to ridicule him.
But Hume had no sooner departed than Frederick's
sham invitation went the round, ultimately
finding its way across the Channel, where it was
printed in the <cite>St. James's Chronicle</cite>. Rousseau,
always on the alert to pose as the victim of
plots and conspiracies, was naturally furious, and
wrote angrily from his retreat at Mr. Davenport's
in Derbyshire to denounce the fabrication.
The worst of it was, that his morbid nature immediately
suspected the innocent Hume of participating
in the trick. 'What rends and afflicts
my heart [is],' he told the <cite>Chronicle</cite>, 'that the
impostor hath his accomplices in England;' and
this delusion became one of the main elements
in that 'twice-told tale,'&mdash;the quarrel of Hume
and Rousseau. Walpole was called upon to
clear Hume from having any hand in the letter,
and several communications, all of which are
printed at length in the fourth volume of his
works, followed upon the same subject. Their
discussion would occupy too large a space in
this limited memoir.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> It is, however, worth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>noticing that Walpole's instinct appears to have
foreseen the trouble that fell upon Hume.
'I wish,' he wrote to Lady Hervey, in a letter
which Hume carried to England when he accompanied
his untunable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</i> thither, 'I
wish he may not repent having engaged with
Rousseau, who contradicts and quarrels with all
mankind, in order to obtain their admiration.'<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
He certainly, upon the present occasion, did not
belie this uncomplimentary character.</p>

<p>Before the last stages of the Hume-Rousseau
controversy had been reached, Hume was back
again in Paris, and Walpole had returned to
London. Upon the whole, he told Mann, he
liked France so well that he should certainly go
there again. In September, 1766, he was once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>more attacked with gout, and at the beginning
of October went to Bath, whose Avon (as compared
with his favourite Thames) he considers
'paltry enough to be the Seine or Tyber.'
Nothing pleases him much at Bath, although it
contained such notabilities as Lord Chatham,
Lord Northington, and Lord Camden; but he
goes to hear Wesley, of whom he writes rather
flippantly to Chute. He describes him as 'a
lean, elderly man, fresh-coloured, his hair
smoothly combed, but with a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soupçon</i> of curl
at the ends.' 'Wondrous clean,' he adds, 'but
as evidently an actor as Garrick. He spoke
his sermon, but so fast, and with so little
accent, that I am sure he has often uttered it,
for it was like a lesson. There were parts and
eloquence in it; but towards the end he exalted
his voice, and acted very ugly enthusiasm; decried
learning, and told stories, like Latimer, of
the fool of his college, who said, 'I <em>thanks</em> God
for everything.'<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> He returned to Strawberry
Hill in October. In August of the next year he
again went to Paris, going almost straight to
Madame du Deffand's, where he finds Mademoiselle
Clairon (who had quitted the stage)
invited to declaim Corneille in his honour, and
he sups in a distinguished company. His visit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>lasted two months; but his letters for this period
contain few interesting particulars, while those
of the lady cease altogether, to be resumed
again on the 9th October, a few hours after his
departure. Two years later he travels once
more to Paris and his blind friend, whom he
finds in better health than ever, and with spirits
so increased that he tells her she will go mad
with age. 'When they ask her how old she
is, she answers, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">J'ai soixante et mille ans</i>."'
Her septuagenarian activity might well have
wearied a younger man. 'She and I,' he says,
'went to the Boulevard last night after supper,
and drove about there till two in the morning.
We are going to sup in the country this evening,
and are to go to-morrow night at eleven to the
puppet-show.' In a letter to George Montagu,
which adds some details to her portrait, he
writes: 'I have heard her dispute with all sorts
of people, on all sorts of subjects, and never
knew her in the wrong.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> She humbles the
learned, sets right their disciples, and finds
conversation for everybody. Affectionate as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>Madame de Sévigné, she has none of her prejudices,
but a more universal taste; and, with
the most delicate frame, her spirits hurry her
through a life of fatigue that would kill me, if I
was to continue here.... I had great difficulty
last night to persuade her, though she was not
well, not to sit up till between two and three
for the comet; for which purpose she had appointed
an astronomer to bring his telescopes to
the President Hénault's, as she thought it would
amuse me. In short, her goodness to me is so
excessive that I feel unashamed at producing
my withered person in a round of diversions,
which I have quitted at home.'<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> One of the
other amusements which she procured for him
was the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrée</i> of the famous convent of St. Cyr,
of which he gives an interesting account. He
inspects the pensioners, and the numerous portraits
of the foundress, Madame de Maintenon.
In one class-room he hears the young ladies
sing the choruses in <cite>Athalie</cite>; in another sees
them dance minuets to the violin of a nun who
is not precisely St. Cecilia. In the third room
they act <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">proverbes</i>, or conversations. Finally, he
is enabled to enrich the archives of Strawberry
with a piece of paper containing a few sentences
of Madame de Maintenon's handwriting.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Walpole's literary productions for this date (in
addition to the letter from the King of Prussia
to Rousseau) are scheduled in the <cite>Short Notes</cite>
with his usual minuteness. In June, 1766,
shortly after his return from Paris, he wrote a
squib upon Captain Byron's description of the
Patagonians, entitled, <cite>An Account of the Giants
lately discovered</cite>, which was published on the
25th August. On 18 August he began his
<cite>Memoirs of the Reign of King George the
Third</cite>; and, in 1767, the detection of a work
published at Paris in two volumes under the
title of the <cite>Testament du Chevalier Robert
Walpole</cite>, and 'stamped in that mint of forgeries,
Holland.' This, which is printed in the
second volume of his works, remained unpublished
during his lifetime, as no English translation
of the <cite>Testament</cite> was ever made. His next
deliverance was a letter, subsequently printed
in the <cite>St. James's Chronicle</cite> for 28 May, in
which he announced to the Corporation of
Lynn, in the person of their Mayor, Mr. Langley,
that he did not intend to offer himself again as
the representative in Parliament of that town.
A wish to retire from all public business, and the
declining state of his health, are assigned as the
reasons for his thus breaking his Parliamentary
connection, which had now lasted for five-and-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>twenty
years. Following upon this comes the
already mentioned account of his action in the
Hume and Rousseau quarrel, and a couple of
letters on <cite>Political Abuse in Newspapers</cite>. These
appeared in the <cite>Public Advertiser</cite>. But the
chief results of his leisure in 1766-8 are to be
found in two efforts more ambitious than any of
those above indicated,&mdash;the <cite>Historic Doubts
on Richard the Third</cite>, and the tragedy of <cite>The
Mysterious Mother</cite>. The <cite>Historic Doubts</cite> was
begun in the winter of 1767, and published in
February, 1768; the tragedy in December, 1766,
and published in March, 1768.</p>

<p>The <cite>Historic Doubts</cite> was an attempt to vindicate
Richard III. from his traditional character,
which Walpole considered had been intentionally
blackened in order to whiten that of Henry
VII. '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vous seriez un excellent attornei général</i>,'&mdash;wrote
Voltaire to him,&mdash;'<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vous pesez toutes
les probabilités</i>.' He might have added that
they were all weighed on one side. Gray
admits the clearness with which the principal
part of the arguments was made out; but he
remained unconvinced, especially as regards
the murder of Henry VI. Other objectors
speedily appeared, who were neither so friendly
nor so gentle. <cite>The Critical Review</cite> attacked
him for not having referred to Guthrie's <cite>History<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
of England</cite>, which had in some respects anticipated
him; and he was also criticised adversely
by the <cite>London Chronicle</cite>. Of these attacks
Walpole spoke and wrote very contemptuously;
but he seems to have been considerably nettled
by the conduct of a Swiss named Deyverdun,
who, giving an account of the book in a work
called <cite>Mémoires Littéraires de la Grande Bretagne</cite>
for 1768, declared his preference for the
views which Hume had expressed in certain
notes to the said account. Deyverdun's action
appears to have stung Walpole into a supplementary
defence of his theories, in which he dealt
with his critics generally. This he did not print,
but set aside to appear as a postscript in his
works. In 1770, however, his arguments were
contested by Dr. Milles, Dean of Exeter, to
whom he replied; and later still, another antiquary,
the Rev. Mr. Masters, came forward.
The last two assailants were members of the
Society of Antiquaries, from which body Walpole,
in consequence, withdrew. But he practically
abandoned his theories in a final postscript, written
in February, 1793, which is to be found in
the second volume of his works.</p>

<p>Concerning the second performance above
referred to, <cite>The Mysterious Mother</cite>, most of
Walpole's biographers are content to abide in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
generalities. That the proprietor of Gothic
Strawberry should have produced <cite>The Castle
of Otranto</cite> has a certain congruity; but one
scarcely expects to find the same person indulging
in a blank-verse tragedy sombre enough to
have taxed the powers of Ford or Webster. It
is a curious example of literary reaction, and
his own words respecting it are doubtful-voiced.
To Montagu and to Madame du Deffand he
writes apologetically. '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il ne vous plairoit pas
assurément</i>,' he informs the lady; '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il n'y a
pas de beaux sentiments. Il n'y a que des passions
sans envelope</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des crimes</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des repentis</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">et des
horreurs</i>;'<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> and he lays his finger on one of its
gravest defects when he goes on to say that its
interest languishes from the first act to the last.
Yet he seems, too, to have thought of its being
played, for he tells Montagu a month later that
though he is not yet intoxicated enough with it
to think it would do for the stage, yet he wishes
to see it acted,&mdash;a wish which must have been
a real one, since he says further that he has
written an epilogue for Mrs. Clive to speak
in character. The postscript which is affixed to
the printed piece contradicts the above utterances
considerably, or, at all events, shows that
fuller consideration has materially revised them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>He admits that <cite>The Mysterious Mother</cite> would
not be proper to appear upon the boards. 'The
subject is so horrid that I thought it would
shock rather than give satisfaction to an audience.
Still, I found it so truly tragic in the
two essential springs of terror and pity that I
could not resist the impulse of adapting it to the
scene, though it should never be practicable to
produce it there.' After his criticism to Madame
du Deffand upon the plot, it is curious to find
him later on claiming that 'every scene tends
to bring on the catastrophe, and [that] the story
is never interrupted or diverted from its course.'
Notwithstanding its imaginative power, it is
impossible to deny that the author's words as to
the repulsiveness of the subject are just. But
it is needless to linger longer upon a dramatic
work which had such grave defects as to render
its being acted impossible, and concerning the
literary merit of which there will always be different
opinions. Byron spoke of it as 'a tragedy
of the highest order,'&mdash;a judgment which has
been traversed by Macaulay and Scott; Miss
Burney shuddered at its very name; while Lady
Di. Beauclerk illustrated it enthusiastically with
a series of seven designs in 'sut-water,'<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>which the enraptured author erected a special
gallery.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Meanwhile, we may quote, from the
close of the above postscript, a passage where
Walpole is at his best. It is a rapid and characteristic
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aperçu</i> of tragedy in England:</p>

<p>'The excellence of our dramatic writers is
by no means equal in number to the great men
we have produced in other walks. Theatric
genius lay dormant after Shakespeare; waked
with some bold and glorious, but irregular and
often ridiculous, flights in Dryden; revived in
Otway; maintained a placid, pleasing kind of
dignity in Rowe, and even shone in his <cite>Jane
Shore</cite>. It trod in sublime and classic fetters
in <cite>Cato</cite>, but void of nature, or the power of
affecting the passions. In Southerne it seemed
a genuine ray of nature and Shakespeare; but,
falling on an age still more Hottentot, was stifled
in those gross and barbarous productions, tragi-comedies.
It turned to tuneful nonsense in
the <cite>Mourning Bride</cite>; grew stark mad in Lee,
whose cloak, a little the worse for wear, fell on
Young, yet in both was still a poet's cloak. It
recovered its senses in Hughes and Fenton, who
were afraid it should relapse, and accordingly
kept it down with a timid but amiable hand;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>and then it languished. We have not mounted
again above the two last.'<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>The <cite>Castle of Otranto</cite> and the <cite>Historic
Doubts</cite> were not printed by Mr. Robinson's
latest successor, Mr. Kirgate. But the Strawberry
Press had by this time resumed its functions,
for <cite>The Mysterious Mother</cite>, of which
50 copies were struck off in 1768, was issued
from it. Another book which it produced in
the same year was <cite>Cornélie</cite>, a youthful tragedy
by Madame du Deffand's friend, President
Hénault. Walpole's sole reason for giving it
the permanence of his type appears to have
been gratitude to the venerable author, then
fast hastening to the grave, for his kindness to
himself in Paris. To Paris three-fourths of the
impression went. More important reprints were
Grammont's <cite>Memoirs</cite>, a small quarto, and a
series of <cite>Letters of Edward VI.</cite>; both printed
in 1772. The list for this period is completed
by the loose sheets of <cite>Hoyland's Poems</cite>, 1769,
and the well-known, but now rare, <cite>Description
of the Villa of Horace Walpole at Strawberry
Hill</cite>, 1774, 100 copies of which were printed,
six being on large paper. To an account of
this patchwork edifice, the ensuing chapter will
be chiefly devoted. The present may fitly be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>concluded with a brief statement of that always-debated
passage in Walpole's life, his relations
with the ill-starred Chatterton.</p>

<p>Towards the close of 1768, and early in
1769, Chatterton, fretting in Mr. Lambert's
office at Bristol, and casting about eagerly
for possible clues to a literary life, had offered
some specimens of the pseudo-Rowley to
James Dodsley of Pall-Mall, but apparently
without success. His next appeal was made
to Walpole, and mainly as the author of the
<cite>Anecdotes of Painting in England</cite>. What
documents he actually submitted to him, is not
perfectly clear; but they manifestly included
further fabrications of monkish verse, and hinted
at, or referred to, a sequence of native artists
in oil, hitherto wholly undreamed of by the
distinguished virtuoso he addressed. The
packet was handed to Walpole at Arlington
Street by Mr. Bathoe, his bookseller (notable
as the keeper of one of the first circulating
libraries in London); and, incredible to say,
Walpole was instantly 'drawn.' He despatched
without delay to his unknown Bristol
correspondent such a courteous note as he
might have addressed to Zouch or Ducarel,
expressing interest, curiosity, and a desire for
further particulars. Chatterton as promptly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
rejoined, forwarding more extracts from the
Rowley poems. But he also, from Walpole's
recollection of his letter, in part unbosomed
himself, making revelation of his position as
a widow's son and lawyer's apprentice, who
had 'a taste and turn for more elegant studies,'
which inclinations, he suggested, his illustrious
correspondent might enable him to gratify.
Upon this, perhaps not unnaturally, Walpole's
suspicions were aroused, the more so that
Mason and Gray, to whom he showed the
papers, declared them to be forgeries. He
made, nevertheless, some private inquiry from
an aristocratic relative at Bath as to Chatterton's
antecedents, and found that, although his description
of himself was accurate, no account
of his character was forthcoming. He accordingly&mdash;he
tells us&mdash;wrote him a letter 'with
as much kindness and tenderness as if he had
been his guardian,' recommending him to stick
to his profession, and adding, by way of postscript,
that judges, to whom the manuscripts had
been submitted, were by no means thoroughly
convinced of their antiquity. Two letters from
Chatterton followed,&mdash;one (the first) dejected
and seemingly acquiescent; the other, a week
later, curtly demanding the restoration of his
papers, the genuineness of which he re-affirmed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
These communications Walpole, by his own
account, either neglected to notice, or overlooked.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
After an interval of some weeks
arrived a final missive, the tone of which he
regarded as 'singularly impertinent.' Snapping
up both poems and letters in a pet, he
scribbled a hasty reply, but, upon reconsideration,
enclosed them to their writer without
comment, and thought no more of him or them.
It was not until about a year and a half afterwards
that Goldsmith told him, at the first
Royal Academy dinner, that Chatterton had
come to London and destroyed himself,&mdash;an
announcement which seems to have filled him
with unaffected pity. 'Several persons of
honour and veracity,' he says, 'were present
when I first heard of his death, and will attest
my surprise and concern.'<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>The apologists of the gifted and precocious
Bristol boy, reading the above occurrences by
the light of his deplorable end, have attributed
to Walpole a more material part in his
misfortunes than can justly be ascribed to
him; and the first editor of Chatterton's <cite>Miscellanies</cite>
did not scruple to emphasize the
current gossip, which represented Walpole as
'the primary cause of his [Chatterton's] dismal
catastrophe,'<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>&mdash;an aspersion which drew
from the Abbot of Strawberry the lengthy
letter on the subject which was afterwards
reprinted in his <cite>Works</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> So long a vindication,
if needed then, is scarcely needed now.
Walpole, it is obvious, acted very much as he
might have been expected to act. He had
been imposed upon, and he was as much
annoyed with himself as with the impostor.
But he was not harsh enough to speak his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>mind frankly, nor benevolent enough to act the
part of that rather rare personage, the ideal
philanthropist. If he had behaved less like an
ordinary man of the world; if he had obtained
Chatterton's confidence, instead of lecturing
him; if he had aided and counselled and
protected him,&mdash;Walpole would have been
different, and things might have been otherwise.
As they were, upon the principle that 'two of
a trade can ne'er agree,' it is difficult
to conceive of any abiding alliance between
the author of the fabricated <cite>Tragedy of Ælla</cite>
and the author of the fabricated <cite>Castle of
Otranto</cite>.</p>

<p>In 1774, when, according to its title-page, the
<cite>Description of Strawberry Hill</cite> was printed,
Walpole was a man of fifty-seven. During the
period covered by the last chapter, many
changes had taken place in his circle of friends.
Mann and George Montagu (until, in October,
1770, his correspondence with the latter mysteriously
ceased) were still the most frequent
recipients of his letters, and next to these, Conway,
and Cole the antiquary. But three of his
former correspondents, his deaf neighbour at
Marble Hill, Lady Suffolk,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Lady Hervey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>(Pope's and Chesterfield's Molly Lepel, to
whom he had written much from Paris), and
Gray, were dead. On the other hand, he had
opened what promised to be a lengthy series
of letters with Gray's friend and biographer,
the Rev. William Mason, Rector of Aston, in
Yorkshire; with Madame du Deffand; and
with the divorced Duchess of Grafton, who in
1769 had married his Paris friend, John Fitzpatrick,
second Earl of Upper Ossory. There
were changes, too, among his own relatives.
By this time his eldest brother's widow, Lady
Orford, had lost her second husband, Sewallis
Shirley, and was again living, not very reputably,
on the Continent. Her son George, who
since 1751 had been third Earl of Orford, and
was still unmarried, was eminently unsatisfactory.
He was shamelessly selfish, and by way
of complicating the family embarrassments, had
taken to the turf. Ultimately he had periodical
attacks of insanity, during which time it fell to
Walpole's fate to look after his affairs. With
Sir Edward Walpole, his second brother, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>seems never to have been on terms of real
cordiality; but he made no secret of his pride
in his beautiful nieces, Edward Walpole's
natural daughters, whose charms and amiability
had victoriously triumphed over every prejudice
which could have been entertained against their
birth. Laura, who was the eldest, had married
a brother of the Earl of Albemarle, subsequently
created Bishop of Exeter; Charlotte, the third,
became Lady Huntingtower, and afterwards
Countess of Dysart; while Maria, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belle</i> of
the trio, was more fortunate still. After burying
her first husband, Lord Waldegrave, she
had succeeded in fascinating H. R. H. William
Henry, Duke of Gloucester, the King's own
brother, and so contributing to bring about the
Royal Marriage Act of 1772. They were
married in 1766; but the fact was not formally
announced to His Majesty until September,
1772.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Another marriage which must have
given Walpole almost as much pleasure was
that of General Conway's daughter to Mr.
Damer, Lord Milton's eldest son, which took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>place in 1767. After the unhappy death of her
husband, who shot himself in a tavern ten years
later, Mrs. Damer developed considerable talents
as a sculptor, and during the last years of Walpole's
life was a frequent exhibitor at the Royal
Academy. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non me Praxiteles finxit, at Anna
Damer</i>, wrote her admiring relative under
one of her works, a wounded eagle in terra-cotta;<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
and in the fourth volume of the <cite>Anecdotes
of Painting</cite>, he likens 'her shock dog,
large as life,' to such masterpieces of antique
art as the Tuscan boar and the Barberini goat.</p>

<p>It is time, however, to return to the story of
Strawberry itself, as interrupted in Chapter V.
In the introduction to Walpole's <cite>Description</cite> of
1774, a considerable interval occurs between
the building of the Refectory and Library in
1753-4, and the subsequent erection of the
Gallery, Round Tower, Great Cloister, and
Cabinet, or Tribune, which, already in contemplation
in 1759, were, according to the same
authority, erected in 1760 and 1761. But here,
as before, the date must rather be that of the
commencement than the completion of these
additions. In May, 1763, he tells Cole that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>the Gallery is fast advancing, and in July it is
almost 'in the critical minute of consummation.'
In August, 'all the earth is begging to come to
see it.' A month afterwards, he is 'keeping an
inn; the sign, "The Gothic Castle."' His
whole time is passed in giving tickets of admission
to the Gallery, and hiding himself when it
is on view. 'Take my advice,' he tells Montagu,
'never build a charming house for yourself
between London and Hampton-court;
everybody will live in it but you.' A year later
he is giving a great fête to the French and
Spanish Ambassadors, March, Selwyn, Lady
Waldegrave, and other distinguished guests,
which finishes in the new room. 'During
dinner there were French horns and clarionets
in the cloister,' and after coffee the guests
were treated 'with a syllabub milked under the
cows that were brought to the brow of the
terrace. Thence they went to the Printing-house,
and saw a new fashionable French song
printed. They drank tea in the Gallery, and at
eight went away to Vauxhall.'</p>

<p>This last entertainment, the munificence of
which, he says, the treasury of the Abbey will
feel, took place in June, 1764; and it is not
until four years later that we get tidings of any
fresh improvements. In September, 1768, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
tells Cole that he is going on with the Round
Tower, or Chamber, at the end of the Gallery,
which, in another letter, he says 'has stood
still these five years,' and he is, besides, '<em>playing</em>
with the little garden on the other side of
the road' which had come into his hands by
Francklin's death. In May of the following
year he gives another magnificent <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">festino</i> at
Strawberry, which will almost mortgage it, but
the Round Tower still progresses. In October,
1770, he is building again, in the intervals of
gout; this time it is the Great Bedchamber,&mdash;a
'sort of room which he seems likely to inhabit
much time together.' Next year the
whole piecemeal structure is rapidly verging
to completion. 'The Round Tower is finished,
and magnificent; and the State Bedchamber
proceeds fast.' In June he is writing to Mann
from the delicious bow window of the former,
with Vasari's Bianca Capello (Mann's present)
over against him, and the setting sun behind,
'throwing its golden rays all round.' Further
on, he is building a tiny brick chapel in the
garden, mainly for the purpose of receiving
'two valuable pieces of antiquity,'&mdash;one being
a painted window from Bexhill of Henry III.
and his Queen, given him by Lord Ashburnham;
the other Cavalini's Tomb of Capoccio from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore at Rome,
which had been sent to him by Sir William (then
Mr.) Hamilton, the English Minister at Naples.
In August, 1772, the Great Bedchamber is finished,
the house is complete, and he has 'at
last exhausted all his hoards and collections.'
Nothing remains but to compile the <cite>Description
and Catalogue</cite>, concerning which he had
written to Cole as far back as 1768, and which,
as already stated, he ultimately printed in 1774.</p>

<p>As time went on, his fresh acquisitions
obliged him to add several <cite>Appendices</cite> to this
issue; and the copy before us, although dated
1774, has supplements which bring the record
down to 1786. A fresh edition, in royal quarto,
with twenty-seven plates, was printed in 1784;<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
and this, or an expansion of it, reappears in
vol. ii. of his <cite>Works</cite>. With these later issues
we have little to do; but with the aid of that
of 1774, may essay to give some brief account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>of the long, straggling, many-pinnacled building,
with its round tower at the end, the east
and south fronts of which are figured in the
black-looking vignette upon the title-page. The
entrance was on the north side, from the Teddington
and Twickenham road, here shaded by
lofty trees; and once within the embattled
boundary wall, covered by this time with ivy,
the first thing that struck the spectator was a
small oratory inclosed by iron rails, with saint,
altar, niches, and holy-water basins designed
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en suite</i> by Mr. Chute. On the right hand&mdash;its
gaily-coloured patches of flower-bed glimmering
through a screen of iron work copied from
the tomb of Roger Niger, Bishop of London,
in old St. Paul's&mdash;was the diminutive Abbot's,
or Prior's, Garden, which extended in front of
the offices to the right of the principal entrance.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
This was along a little cloister to the left,
beyond the oratory. The chief decoration of
this cloister was a marble <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bas-relief</i>, inscribed
'Dia Helionora,' being, in fact, a portrait of
that Leonora D'Esté who turned the head of
Tasso. At the end was the door, which opened
into 'a small gloomy hall' united with the staircase,
the balustrades of which, designed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a><br /><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>Bentley, were decorated with antelopes, the
Walpole supporters. In the well of the staircase
was a Gothic lantern of japanned tin, also
due to Bentley's fertile invention. If, instead
of climbing the stairs, you turned out of the
hall into a little passage on your left, you found
yourself in the Refectory, or Great Parlour,
where were accumulated the family portraits.
Here, over the chimney-piece, was the 'conversation,'
by Sir Joshua Reynolds, representing
the triumvirate of Selwyn, Williams, and Lord
Edgcumbe, already referred to at p. <a href="#Page_138">138</a>; here
also were Sir Robert Walpole and his two wives,
Catherine Shorter and Maria Skerret; Robert
Walpole the second, and his wife in a white
riding-habit; Horace himself by Richardson;
Dorothy Walpole, his aunt, who became Lady
Townshend;<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> his sister, Lady Maria Churchill;
and a number of others. In the Waiting Room,
into which the Refectory opened, was a stone
head of John Dryden, whom Catherine Shorter
claimed as great-uncle; next to this again was
the China Closet, neatly lined with blue and
white Dutch tiles, and having its ceiling painted
by Müntz, after a villa at Frascati, with convolvuluses
on poles. In the China Room,
among great stores of Sèvres and Chelsea, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>oriental china, perhaps the greatest curiosity
was a couple of Saxon tankards, exactly alike
in form and size, which had been presented to
Sir Robert Walpole at different times by the
mistresses of the first two Georges, the Duchess
of Kendal and the Countess of Yarmouth. To
the left of the China Closet, with a bow window
looking to the south, was the Little Parlour,
which was hung with stone-coloured 'gothic
paper' in imitation of mosaic, and decorated
with the 'wooden prints' already referred to,
the chiaroscuros of Jackson;<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> and at the side
of this came the Yellow Bedchamber, known
later, from its numerous feminine portraits, as
the Beauty Room. The other spaces on the
ground floor were occupied, towards the Prior's
Garden, by the kitchen, cellars, and servants'
hall, and, at the back, by the Great Cloister,
which went under the Gallery.</p>

<p>Returning to the staircase, where, in later
years, hung Bunbury's original drawing<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>well-known caricature of 'Richmond Hill,' you
entered the Breakfast Room on the first floor,
the window of which looked towards the
Thames. It was pleasantly furnished with blue
paper, and blue and white linen, and contained
many miniatures and portraits, notable among
which were Carmontel's picture of Madame du
Deffand and the Duchess de Choiseul;<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> a print
of Madame du Deffand's room and cats, given
by the President Hénault; and a view painted
by Raguenet for Walpole in 1766 of the Hôtel
de Carnavalet, the former residence of Madame
de Sévigné.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>The Breakfast Room opened into the Green
Closet, over the door of which was a picture
by Samuel Scott of Pope's house at Twickenham,
showing the wings added after the poet's
death by Sir William Stanhope. On the same
side of the room hung Hogarth's portrait of
Sarah Malcolm the murderess, painted at Newgate
a day or two before her execution in
Fleet Street.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Here also was 'Mr. Thomas
Gray; etched from his shade [silhouette]; by
Mr. W. Mason.' There were many other
portraits in this room, besides some water
colours on ivory by Horace himself. In a line
with the Green Closet, and looking east, was
the Library; and at the back of it, the Blue
Bedchamber, the toilette of which was worked
by Mrs. Clive, who, since her retirement from
the stage in 1769, had lived wholly at Twickenham.
The chief pictures in this room were
Eckardt's portraits of Gray in a Vandyke dress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>and of Walpole himself in similar attire.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> There
were also by the same artist pictures of Walpole's
father and mother, and of General Conway and
his wife, Lady Ailesbury.</p>

<p>Facing the Blue Bedchamber was the
Armoury, a vestibule of three Gothic arches,
in the left-hand corner of which was the door
opening into the Library, a room twenty-eight
feet by nineteen feet six, lighted by a large
window looking to the east, and by two smaller
rose-windows at the sides. The books, arranged
in Gothic arches of pierced work, went all
round it. The chimney-piece was imitated from
the tomb of John of Eltham in Westminster
Abbey, and the stone work from another tomb
at Canterbury. Over the chimney-piece was a
picture (which is engraved in the <cite>Anecdotes of
Painting</cite>) representing the marriage of Henry
VI. Walpole and Bentley had designed the
ceiling,&mdash;a gorgeous heraldic medley surrounding
a central Walpole shield. Above the bookcases
were pictures. One of the greatest
treasures of the room was a clock given by
Henry VIII. to Anne Boleyn. Of the books
it is impossible to speak in detail. Noticeable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a><br /><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>among them, however, was a Thuanus in
fourteen volumes, a very extensive set of
Hogarth's prints, and all the original drawings
for the <cite>Ædes Walpolianæ</cite>. Vertue, Hollar,
and Faithorne were also largely represented.
Among special copies, were the identical <cite>Iliad</cite>
and <cite>Odyssey</cite> from which Pope made his translations
of Homer,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> a volume containing Bentley's
original designs for Gray's <cite>Poems</cite>, and a black
morocco pocket-book of sketches by Jacques
Callot. In a rosewood case in this room was
also a fine collection of coins, which included
the rare silver medal struck by Gregory XIII.
on the Massacre of St. Bartholomew.</p>

<p>Concerning the Red Bedchamber, the Star
Chamber, and the Holbein Chamber, which
intervened between the rest of the first floor
and the latest additions, there is little to say.
In the Red Bedchamber, the most memorable
things (after the chintz bed on which Lord
Orford died) were some pencil sketches of
Pope and his parents by Cooper and the elder
Richardson. In the Holbein Chamber, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>called from a number of copies on oil-paper by
Vertue from the drawings of Holbein in Queen
Catherine's Closet at Kensington, were two of
those 'curiosities' which represent the Don
Saltero, or Madame Tussaud, side of Strawberry,
viz., a tortoise-shell comb studded with
silver hearts and roses which was said to have
belonged to Mary, Queen of Scots, and (later)
the red hat of Cardinal Wolsey. The pedigree
of the hat, it must, however, be admitted, was
unimpeachable. It had been found in the
great wardrobe by Bishop Burnet when Clerk
of the Closet. From him it passed to his son
the Judge (author of that curious squib on
Harley known as the <cite>History of Robert Powel
the Puppet-Show-Man</cite>), and thence to the
Countess Dowager of Albemarle, who gave it
to Walpole. A carpet in this room was worked
by Mrs. Clive, who seems to have been a most
industrious decorator of her friend's mansion
museum.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> The Star Chamber was but an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>ante-room powdered with gold stars in mosaic,
the chief glory of which was a stone bust of
Henry VII. by Torregiano.</p>

<p>With these three rooms, the first floor of
Strawberry, as it existed previous to the erection
of the additions mentioned in the beginning
of this chapter,&mdash;namely, the Gallery, the
Round Tower, the Tribune, and the Great
North Bedchamber,&mdash;came to an end. But it
was in these newer parts of the house that
some of its rarest objects of art were assembled.
The Gallery, which was entered from a gloomy
little passage in front of the Holbein Chamber,
was a really spacious room, fifty-six feet by
thirteen, and lighted from the south by five high
windows. Between these were tables laden
with busts, bronzes, and urns; on the opposite
side, fronting the windows, were recesses,
finished with gold network over looking-glass,
between which stood couch-seats, covered, like
the rest of the room, with crimson Norwich
damask. The ceiling was copied from one of
the side aisles of Henry VII.'s Chapel; the
great door at the western end, which led into
the Round Tower, was taken from the north
door of St. Albans. A long carpet, made at
Moorfields, traversed the room from end to
end. In one of the recesses&mdash;that to the left of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the chimney-piece, which was designed by
Mr. Chute and Mr. Thomas Pitt of Boconnoc,&mdash;stood
one of the finest surviving pieces of
Greek sculpture, the Boccapadugli eagle, found
in the precinct of the Baths of Caracalla,&mdash;a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d'œuvre</i> from which Gray is said to have
borrowed the 'ruffled plumes, and flagging
wing' of the <cite>Progress of Poesy</cite>; to the right
was a noble bust in basalt of Vespasian, which
had been purchased from the Ottoboni collection.
Of the pictures it is impossible to speak
at large; but two of the most notable were
Sir George Villiers, the father of the Duke of
Buckingham, and Mabuse's <cite>Marriage of Henry
VII. and Elizabeth of York</cite>. Of Walpole's
own relatives, there were portraits by Ramsay
of his nieces, Mrs. Keppel (the Bishop's wife)
and Lady Dysart, and of the Duchess of
Gloucester (then Lady Waldegrave) by Reynolds.
There were also portraits of Henry
Fox, Lord Holland, of George Montagu, of
Lord Waldegrave, and of Horace's uncle, Lord
Walpole of Wolterton.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>Issuing through the great door of the Gallery,
and passing on the left a glazed closet con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>taining
a quantity of china which had once belonged
to Walpole's mother, a couple of steps
brought you into the pleasant Drawing Room in
the Round Tower, the bow window of which,
already mentioned, looked to the south-west.
Like the Gallery, this room was hung with
Norwich damask. Its chief glory was the picture
of Bianca Capello, of which Walpole had
written to Mann. To the left of this room, at
the back of the Gallery, and consequently in the
front of the house, was the Cabinet, or Tribune,
a curious square chamber with semicircular recesses,
in two of which, to the north and west,
were stained windows. In the roof, which was
modelled on the chapter house at York, was a
star of yellow glass throwing a soft golden glow
over all the room. Here Walpole had amassed
his choicest treasures, miniatures by Oliver and
Cooper, enamels by Petitot and Zincke,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> bronzes
from Italy, ivory bas-reliefs, seal-rings and reli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>quaries,
caskets and cameos and filigree work.
Here, with Madame du Deffand's letter inside
it,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> was the 'round white snuff-box' with
Madame de Sévigné's portrait; here, carven
with masks and flies and grasshoppers, was
Cellini's silver bell from the Leonati Collection,
at Parma, a masterpiece against which he had
exchanged all his collection of Roman coins with
the Marquis of Rockingham. A bronze bust of
Caligula with silver eyes; a missal with reputed
miniatures by Raphael; a dagger of Henry VIII.,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
and a mourning ring given at the burial of
Charles I.,&mdash;were among the other show objects
of the Tribune, the riches of which occupy more
space in their owner's Catalogue than any other
part of his collections.</p>

<p>With the Great North Bedchamber, which
adjoined the Tribune, and filled the remaining
space at the back of the Gallery, the account of
Strawberry Hill, as it existed in 1774, comes to
an end; for the Green Chamber in the Round
Tower over the Drawing Room, and 'Mr. Walpole's
Bedchamber, two pair of stairs' (which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>contained the Warrant for beheading King
Charles I., inscribed 'Major Charta,' so often
referred to by Walpole's biographers),<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> may be
dismissed without further notice. The Beauclerk
Closet, a later addition, will be described
in its proper place. Over the chimney-piece in
the Great North Bedchamber was a large picture
of Henry VIII. and his children, a recent purchase,
afterwards remanded to the staircase to
make room for a portrait of Catherine of Braganza,
sent from Portugal previous to her marriage
with Charles II. Fronting the bed was
a head of Niobe, by Guido, which in its turn
subsequently made way for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la belle Jennings</i>.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
Among the pictures on the north or window side
of the room was the original sketch by Hogarth
of the <cite>Beggar's Opera</cite>, which Walpole had purchased
at the sale of Rich, the fortunate manager
who produced Gay's masterpiece at Lincoln's
Inn Fields. It was exhibited at Manchester in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>1857, being then the property of Mr. Willett,
who had bought it at the Strawberry Hill sale of
1842. Another curious oil painting in this room
was the <cite>Rehearsal of an Opera</cite> by the Riccis,
which included caricature portraits of Nicolini
(of <cite>Spectator</cite> celebrity), of the famous Mrs.
Catherine Tofts, and of Margherita de l'Epine.
In a nook by the window there was a glazed
china closet, with a number of minor curiosities,
among which were conspicuous the speculum of
cannel coal with which Dr. Dee was in the
habit of gulling his votaries,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> and an agate puncheon
with Gray's arms which his executors had
presented to Walpole.</p>

<p>A few external objects claim a word. In the
Great Cloister under the Gallery was the blue
and white china tub in which had taken place
that tragedy of the 'pensive Selima' referred to
at p. <a href="#Page_135">135</a> as having prompted the muse of Gray.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
The Chapel in the Garden has already been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>sufficiently described.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> In the Flower Garden
across the road was a cottage which Walpole
had erected upon the site of the building once
occupied by Francklin the printer, and which he
used as a place of refuge when the tide of sight-seers
became overpowering. It included a Tea
Room, containing a fair collection of china, and
hung with green paper and engravings, and a little
white and green Library, of which the principal
ornament was a half-length portrait of Milton.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
A portrait of Lady Hervey, by Allan Ramsay,
was afterwards added to its decorations.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>Many objects of interest, as must be obvious,
have remained undescribed in the foregoing
account, and those who seek for further infor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>mation
concerning what its owner called his
'paper fabric and assemblage of curious trifles'
must consult either the Catalogue of 1774 itself,
or that later and definitive version of it which is
reprinted in Volume II. of the <cite>Works</cite> (pp. 393-516).
The intention in the main has here been
to lay stress upon those articles which bear most
directly upon Walpole's biography. It will also
be observed that, during the prolonged progress
of the house towards completion, his experience
and his views considerably enlarged, and the
pettiness and artificiality of his first improvements
disappeared. The house never lost, and
never could lose, its invertebrate character; but
the Gallery, the Round Tower, and the North
Bedchamber were certainly conceived in a more
serious and even spacious spirit of Gothicism
than any of the early additions. That it must,
still, have been confined and needlessly gloomy,
may be allowed; but as a set-off to some of
those accounts which insist so pertinaciously
upon its 'paltriness,' its 'architectural solecisms,'
and its lack of beauty and sublimity, it is only
fair to recall a few sentences from the preface
which its owner prefixed to the <cite>Description</cite> of
1784. It was designed, he says of the Catalogue,
to exhibit 'specimens of Gothic architecture, as
collected from standards in cathedrals and chapel-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>tombs,'
and to show 'how they may be applied
to chimney-pieces, ceilings, windows, balustrades,
loggias, etc.' Elsewhere he characterizes
the building itself as candidly as any of
its critics. He admits its diminutive scale and
its unsubstantial character (he calls it himself,
as we have seen, a 'paper fabric'), and he confesses
to the incongruities arising from an antique
design and modern decorations. 'In truth,' he
concludes, 'I did not mean to make my house so
Gothic as to exclude convenience, and modern
refinements in luxury.... It was built to please
my own taste, and in some degree to realize my
own visions. I have specified what it contains;
could I describe the gay but tranquil scene
where it stands, and add the beauty of the landscape
to the romantic cast of the mansion, it
would raise more pleasing sensations than a dry
list of curiosities can excite,&mdash;at least the prospect
would recall the good humour of those who
might be disposed to condemn the fantastic fabric,
and to think it a very proper habitation of, as it
was the scene that inspired, the author of the
<cite>Castle of Otranto</cite>.'<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> As one of his censors has
remarked, this tone disarms criticism; and it
is needless to accumulate proofs of peculiarities
which are not denied by the person most
concerned.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>
<p>In spite of its charming situation, Strawberry
Hill was emphatically a summer residence;
and there is more than one account in
Walpole's letters of the sudden floods which,
when Thames flowed with a fuller tide than
now, occasionally surprised the inhabitants of
the pleasant-looking villas along its banks. It
was decidedly damp, and its gouty owner had
sometimes to quit it precipitately for Arlington
Street, where, he says, 'after an hour,' he
revives, 'like a member of parliament's wife.'
His best editor, Mr. Peter Cunningham, whose
knowledge as an antiquary was unrivalled,&mdash;for
was he not the author of the <cite>Handbook
of London</cite>?&mdash;has amused himself, in an odd
corner of one of his prefaces, by retracing the
route taken in these townward flights. The
extract is so packed with suggestive memories
that no excuse is needed for reproducing it
(with a few now necessary notes) as the tail-piece
of the present chapter.</p>

<p>'At twelve his [Walpole's] light bodied
chariot was at the door, with his English coachman
and his Swiss valet [Philip Colomb]....
In a few minutes he left Lord Radnor's villa
to the right, rolled over the grotto of Pope,
saw on his left Whitton, rich with recollections
of Kneller and Argyll, passed Gumley House,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
one of the country seats of his father's opponent
and his own friend, Pulteney, Earl of
Bath, and Kendal House,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> the retreat of the
mistress of George I., Ermengard de Schulenburg,
Duchess of Kendal. At Sion, the princely
seat of the Percys, the Seymours, and the
Smithsons, he turned into the Hounslow
Road, left Sion on his right, and Osterly, not
unlike Houghton, on his left, and rolled through
Brentford,&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Brentford, the Bishopric of Parson Horne,"<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a><br />
</p>

<p>then, as now, infamous for its dirty streets, and
famous for its white-legged chickens.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Quitting
Brentford, he approached the woods that
concealed the stately mansion of Gunnersbury,
built by Inigo Jones and Webb, and then inhabited
by the Princess Amelia, the last surviving
child of King George II.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Here he was
often a visitor, and seldom returned without
being a winner at silver loo. At the Pack
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>Horse<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> on Turnham Green he would, when the
roads were heavy, draw up for a brief bait.
Starting anew, he would pass a few red brick
houses on both sides, then the suburban villas
of men well to do in the Strand and Charing
Cross. At Hammersmith, he would leave the
church<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> on his right, call on Mr. Fox at Holland
House, look at Campden House, with
recollections of Sir Baptist Hickes,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> and not
without an ill-suppressed wish to transfer some
little part of it to his beloved Strawberry. He
was now at Kensington Church, then, as it still
is, an ungraceful structure,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> but rife with associations
which he would at times relate to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>friend he had with him. On his left he would
leave the gates of Kensington Palace, rich with
reminiscences connected with his father and
the first Hanoverian kings of this country. On
his right he would quit the red brick house in
which the Duchess of Portsmouth lived,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> and
after a drive of half a mile (skirting a heavy
brick wall), reach Kingston House,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> replete
with stories of Elizabeth Chudleigh, the bigamist
maid of honour, and Duchess-Countess
of Kingston and Bristol. At Knightsbridge
(even then the haunt of highwaymen less
gallant than Maclean) he passed on his left
the little chapel<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> in which his father was
married. At Hyde Park Corner he saw the
Hercules Pillars ale-house of Fielding and
Tom Jones,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> and at one door from Park Lane
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>would occasionally call on old "Q" for the
sake of Selwyn, who was often there.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> The
trees which now grace Piccadilly were in the
Green Park in Walpole's day; they can recollect
Walpole, and that is something. On his
left, the sight of Coventry House<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> would remind
him of the Gunnings, and he would tell his
friend the story of the "beauties;" with which
(short story-teller as he was) he had not completed
when the chariot turned into Arlington
Street on the right, or down Berkeley Street
into Berkeley Square, on the left.'<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> In these
last lines Mr. Cunningham anticipates our story,
for in 1774, Walpole had not yet taken up his
residence in Berkeley Square.</p>

<p>After the completion of Strawberry Hill
and the printing of the <cite>Catalogue</cite>, Walpole's
life grows comparatively barren of events.
There are still four volumes of his <cite>Correspondence</cite>,
but they take upon them imperceptibly
the nature of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nouvelles à la main</i>, and are less
fruitful in personal traits. Between his books
and his prints, his time passes agreeably, 'but
will not do to relate.' Indeed, from this period
until his death, in 1797, the most notable occurrences
in his history are his friendship with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Miss Berry's in 1787-8, and his belated accession
to he Earldom of Orford. Both at
Strawberry and Arlington Street, his increasing
years and his persistent malady condemn
him more and more to seclusion and retirement.
He is most at Strawberry, despite its dampness,
for in the country he holds 'old, useless people
ought to live.' 'If you were not to be in
London,' he tells Lady Ossory in April, 1774,
'the spring advances so charmingly, I think I
should scarce go thither. One is frightened
with the inundation of breakfasts and balls that
are coming on. Every one is engaged to everybody
for the next three weeks, and if one must
hunt for a needle, I had rather look for it in a
bottle of hay in the country than in a crowd.'
'By age and situation,' he writes from Strawberry
in September, 'at this time of the year I
live with nothing but old women. They do very
well for me, who have little choice left, and who
rather prefer common nonsense to wise nonsense,&mdash;the
only difference I know between old
women and old men. I am out of all politics,
and never think of elections, which I think I
should hate even if I loved politics,&mdash;just as, if
I loved tapestry I do not think I could talk over
the manufacture of worsteds. Books I have
almost done with too,&mdash;at least, read only such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
as nobody else would read. In short, my way
of life is too insipid to entertain anybody but
myself; and though I am always employed, I
must own I think I have given up every thing
in the world, only to be busy about the most
arrant trifles.' His London life was not greatly
different. 'How should I see or know anything?'
he says a year later, apologizing for his
dearth of news. 'I seldom stir out of my
house [at Arlington Street] before seven in the
evening, see very few persons, and go to fewer
places, make no new acquaintance, and have
seen most of my old wear out. Loo at Princess
Amelie's, loo at Lady Hertford's, are the
capital events of my history, and a Sunday alone,
at Strawberry, my chief entertainment. All this
is far from gay; but as it neither gives me <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i>,
nor lowers my spirits, it is not uncomfortable,
and I prefer it to being <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déplacé</i> in younger company.'
Such is his account of his life in 1774-5,
when he is nearing sixty, and it probably represents
it with sufficient accuracy. But a trifling
incident easily stirs him into unwonted vivacity.
While he is protesting that he has nothing to
say, his letters grow under his pen, and, almost
as a necessary consequence of his leisure, they
become more frequent and more copious. In
the edition of Cunningham, up to September,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
1774, they number fourteen hundred and fifty.
Speaking roughly, this represents a period of
nearly forty years. During the two-and-twenty
years that remained to him, he managed to
swell them by what was, proportionately, a
far greater number. The last letter given by
Cunningham is marked 2665; and this enumeration
does not include a good many letters and
fragments of letters belonging to this later
period, which were published in 1865 in Miss
Berry's <cite>Journals and Correspondence</cite>. Nevertheless,
as stated above, they more and more
assume what he somewhere calls 'their proper
character of newspapers.'</p>

<p>During the remainder of his life, they were
his chief occupation, and his gout was seldom
so severe but that he could make shift to scribble
a line to his favourite correspondents, calling
in his printer Kirgate as secretary in cases
of extremity.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Of literature generally he pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>fessed
to have taken final leave. 'I no longer
care about fame,' he tells Mason in 1774; 'I
have done being an author.' Nevertheless, the
<cite>Short Notes</cite> piously chronicle the production
of more than one trifle, which are reprinted in
his <cite>Works</cite>. When, in the above year, Lord
Chesterfield's letters to his son were published,
Walpole began a parody of that famous performance
in a <cite>Series of Letters from a Mother
to a Daughter</cite>, with the general title of the <cite>New
Whole Duty of Woman</cite>. He grew tired of the
idea too soon to enable us to judge what his
success might have been with a subject which,
in his hands, should have been diverting as a
satire; for, although he was a warm admirer of
Chesterfield's parts, as he had shown in his character
of him in the <cite>Royal and Noble Authors</cite>, he
was thoroughly alive to the assailable side of
what he styles his 'impertinent institutes of
education.'<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Another work of this year was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>reply to some remarks by Mr. Masters in the
<cite>Archæologia</cite> upon the old subject of the <cite>Historic
Doubts</cite>, which calls for no further notice.
But early in 1775 he was persuaded into writing
an epilogue for the <cite>Braganza</cite> of Captain Robert
Jephson, a maiden tragedy of the <cite>Venice Preserved</cite>
order, which was produced at Drury Lane
in February of that year, with considerable success.
In a correspondence which ensued with
the author, Walpole delivered himself of his
views on tragedy for the benefit of Mr. Jephson,
who acted upon them, but not (as his Mentor
thought) with conspicuous success, in his next
attempt, the <cite>Law of Lombardy</cite>. Jephson's third
play, however, the <cite>Count of Narbonne</cite>, which
was well received in 1781, had a natural claim
upon Walpole's good opinion, since it was based
upon the <cite>Castle of Otranto</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Besides the above
letters on tragedy, Walpole wrote, 'in 1775
and 1776,' a rather longer paper on comedy,
which is printed with them in the second volume
of his works (pp. 315-22). He held, as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>says, 'a good comedy the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d'œuvre</i> of
human genius;' and it is manifest that his keenest
sympathies were on the side of comic art.
His remarks upon Congreve are full of just
appreciation. Yet, although he mentions the
<cite>School for Scandal</cite> (which, by the way, shows
that he must have written rather later than the
dates given above), he makes no reference to
the most recent development, in <cite>She Stoops to
Conquer</cite>, of the school of humour and character,
and he seems rather to pose as the advocate
of that genteel or sentimental comedy which
Foote and Goldsmith and Sheridan had striven
to drive from the English stage. When his prejudices
are aroused, he is seldom a safe guide,
and in addition to his personal contempt for
Goldsmith,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> that writer had irritated him by his
reference to the Albemarle Street Club, to
which many of his friends belonged. It was
an additional offence that the 'Miss Biddy
[originally Miss Rachael] Buckskin' of the
comedy was said to stand for Miss Rachael
Lloyd, long housekeeper at Kensington Palace,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>and a member of the club well known both to
himself and to Madame du Deffand.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>In the second of the letters to Mr. Jephson,
Walpole refers to his own efforts at comedy,
and implies that he had made attempts in this
direction even before the tragedy of <cite>The Mysterious
Mother</cite>. He had certainly the wit, and
much of the gift of direct expression, which
comedy requires. But nothing of these earlier
essays appears to have survived, and the only
dramatic effort included among his <cite>Works</cite> (his
tragedy excepted) is the little piece entitled
<cite>Nature will Prevail</cite>, which, with its fairy
machinery, has something of the character of
such earlier productions of Mr. W. S. Gilbert
as the <cite>Palace of Truth</cite>. This he wrote in
1773, and, according to the <cite>Short Notes</cite>, sent
it anonymously to the elder Colman, then
manager of Covent Garden. Colman (he says)
was much pleased with it, but regarding it
as too short for a farce, wished to have it
enlarged. This, however, its author thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>too much trouble 'for so slight and extempore
a performance.' Five years after, it was produced
at the little theatre in the Haymarket, and,
being admirably acted,&mdash;says the <cite>Biographia
Dramatica</cite>,&mdash;met with considerable applause.
But it is obviously one of those works to which
the verdict of Goldsmith's critic, that it would
have been better if the author had taken more
pains, may judiciously be applied. It is more
like a sketch for a farce than a farce itself; and
it is not finished enough for a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">proverbe</i>. Yet
the dialogue is in parts so good that one almost
regrets the inability of the author to nerve himself
for an enterprise <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de longue haleine</i>.</p>

<p>Between 1774 and 1780 the Strawberry Hill
Press still now and then showed signs of vitality.
In 1775, it printed as a loose sheet some verses
by Charles James Fox,&mdash;celebrating, as Amoret,
that lover of the Whigs, the beautiful Mrs.
Crewe,&mdash;and three hundred copies of an
Eclogue by Mr. Fitzpatrick,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> entitled <cite>Dorinda</cite>,
which contains the couplet,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">'And oh! what Bliss, when each alike is pleas'd,</div>
    <div class="verse">the Hand that squeezes, and the Hand that's squeez'd.'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>These were followed, in 1778, by the <cite>Sleep
Walker</cite>, a comedy from the French of Madame
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>du Deffand's friend Pont de Veyle, translated
by Lady Craven, afterwards Margravine of
Anspach, and played for a charitable purpose
at Newbury. A year later came the vindication
of his conduct to Chatterton, already mentioned
at pp. <a href="#Page_196">196-200</a>; and after this a sheet of verse
by Mr. Charles Miller to Lady Horatia Waldegrave,<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
a daughter of the Duchess of Gloucester
by her first husband. The last work of any
importance was the fourth volume of the <cite>Anecdotes
of Painting</cite>, which had been printed as far
back as 1770, but was not issued until Oct.,
1780. This delay, the Advertisement informs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>us, arose 'from motives of tenderness.' The
author was 'unwilling [he says] to utter even
gentle censures, which might wound the affections,
or offend the prejudices, of those related
to the persons whom truth forbad him to commend
beyond their merits.'<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> But despite his
unwillingness to 'dispense universal panegyric,'
and the limitation of his theme to living professors,
he manages, in the same Advertisement,
to distribute a fair amount of praise to some of
his particular favourites. Of H. W. Bunbury,
the husband of Goldsmith's 'Little Comedy,' he
says that he is the 'second Hogarth,' and the
'first imitator who ever fully equalled his original,'&mdash;which
is sheer extravagance. He lauds
the miniature copying of Lady Lucan, as almost
depreciating the 'exquisite works' of the artists
she follows,&mdash;to wit, Cooper and the Olivers;
and he speaks of Lady Di. Beauclerk's drawings
as 'not only inspired by Shakespeare's
insight into nature, but by the graces and taste
of Grecian artists.' After this, the comparison
of Mrs. Damer with Bernini seems almost tame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet her works 'from the life are not inferior to
the antique, and those ... were not more
like.' One can scarcely blame Walpole severely
for this hearty backing of the friends who had
added so much to the attractions of his Gothic
castle; but the value of his criticisms, in many
other instances sound enough, is certainly
impaired by his loyalty to the old-new practice
of 'log-rolling.'</p>

<p>Lady Di. Beauclerk, whose illustrations to
Dryden's <cite>Fables</cite> are still a frequent item in
second-hand catalogues, has a personal connection
with Strawberry through the curious
little closet bearing her name, which, with the
assistance of Mr. Essex, a Gothic architect
from Cambridge, Walpole in 1776-8 managed
to tuck in between the Cabinet and the Round
Tower. It was built on purpose to hold the
'seven incomparable drawings,' executed in
a fortnight, which her Ladyship prepared, to
illustrate <cite>The Mysterious Mother</cite>. These were
the designs to which he refers in the <cite>Anecdotes
of Painting</cite>, and, in a letter to Mann, says
could not be surpassed by Guido and Salvator
Rosa. They were hung on Indian blue
damask, in frames of black and gold; and
Clive's friend, Miss Pope, the actress, when
she dined at Strawberry, was affected by them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
to such a degree that she shed tears, although
she did not know the story,&mdash;an anecdote
which may be regarded either as a genuine
compliment to Lady Di., or a merely histrionic
tribute to her entertainer. 'The drawings,'
Walpole says, 'do not shock and disgust, like
their original, the tragedy;' but they were not
to be shown to the profane. They were, nevertheless,
probably exhibited pretty freely, as a
copy of the play, carefully annotated in MS.
by the author, and bound in blue leather to
match the hangings, was always kept in a
drawer of one of the tables, for the purpose of
explaining them.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> Walpole afterwards added
one or two curiosities to this closet. It contained,
according to the last edition of the
<cite>Catalogue</cite>, a head in basalt of Jupiter Serapis,
and a book of Psalms illuminated by Giulio
Clovio, the latter purchased for £168 at the
Duchess of Portland's sale in May, 1786. There
was also a portrait by Powell, after Reynolds,
of Lady Di. herself, who lived for some time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>at Twickenham in a house now known as
Little Marble Hill, many of the rooms of
which she decorated with her own performances.
These were apparently the efforts
which prompted the already mentioned postscript
to the <cite>Parish Register of Twickenham</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>Mention has been made of the intermittent
attacks of insanity to which Walpole's nephew,
the third Earl of Orford, was subject. At the
beginning of 1774, he had returned to his senses,
and his uncle, on whom fell the chief care
of his affairs during his illnesses, was, for a
brief period, freed from the irksome strain of an
uncongenial and a thankless duty. In April,
1777, however, Lord Orford's malady broke
out again, with redoubled severity. In August,
he was still fluctuating 'between violence and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>stupidity;' but in March, 1778, a lucid interval
had once more been reached, and Walpole
was relieved of the care of his person. Of his
affairs he had declined to take care, as his
Lordship had employed a lawyer of whom
Walpole had a bad opinion. 'He has resumed
the entire dominion of himself,' says a letter
to Mann in April, 'and is gone into the
country, and intends to command the militia.'
One of the earliest results of this 'entire dominion'
was a step which filled his relative with
the keenest distress. He offered the famous
Houghton collection of pictures to Catherine
of Russia,&mdash;'the most signal mortification to
my idolatry for my father's memory that it
could receive,' says Walpole to Lady Ossory.
By August, 1779, the sale was completed.
'The sum stipulated,' he tells Mann, 'is forty
or forty-five thousand pounds,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> I neither know
nor care which; nor whether the picture
merchant ever receives the whole sum, which
probably he will not do, as I hear it is to be
discharged at three payments,&mdash;a miserable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>bargain for a mighty empress!... Well!
adieu to Houghton! about its mad master I
shall never trouble myself more.... Since
he has stript Houghton of its glory, I do not
care a straw what he does with the stone or
the acres!'<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>Not very long after the date of the above
letter Walpole made what was, for him, an
important change of residence. The lease of
his house in Arlington Street running out, he
fixed upon a larger one in the then very
fashionable district of Berkeley Square. The
house he selected, now (1892) numbered 11,
was then 40,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> and he had commenced negotiations
for its purchase as early as November,
1777, when, he tells Lady Ossory, he had
come to town to take possession. But difficulties
arose over the sale, and he found himself
involved in a Chancery suit. He was too
adroit, however, to allow this to degenerate
into an additional annoyance, and managed
(by his own account) to turn what promised
to be a tedious course of litigation into a combat
of courtesy. Ultimately, in July, 1779, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>had won his cause, and was hurrying from
Strawberry to pay his purchase money and
close the bargain. Two months later, he is
moving in, and is delighted with his acquisition.
He would not change his two pretty
mansions for any in England, he says. On
the 14th October, he took formal possession,
upon which day&mdash;his 'inauguration day'&mdash;he
dates his first letter 'Berkeley Square.' 'It
is seeming to take a new lease of life,' he tells
Mason. 'I was born in Arlington Street,
lived there about fourteen years, returned
thither, and passed thirty-seven more; but I
have sober monitors that warn me not to delude
myself.' He had still a decade and a half
before him.</p>

<p>Little more than twelve months after he had
settled down in his new abode, he lost the
faithful friend at Paris, to whom, for the space
of fifteen years, he had written nearly once a
week. By 1774, he had become somewhat
nervous about this accumulated correspondence
in a language not his own. For an Englishman,
his French was good, and, as might be expected
of anything he wrote, characteristic and vivacious.
But, almost of necessity, it contained
many minor faults of phraseology and arrangement,
besides abounding in personal anecdote;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and he became apprehensive lest, after Madame
du Deffand's death, his utterances should fall
into alien hands. General Conway, who visited
Paris in October, 1774, had therefore been
charged to beg for their return&mdash;a request
which seems at first to have been met by the
reply on the lady's part that sufficient precautions
had already been taken for ensuring their
restoration. Ultimately, however, they were
handed to Conway.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> It was in all probability
under a sense of this concession that Walpole
once more risked a tedious journey to visit his
blind friend. In the following year he went to
Paris, to find her, as usual, impatiently expecting
his arrival. She sat with him until half-past
two, and before his eyes were open again, he
had a letter from her. 'Her soul is immortal,
and forces her body to keep it company.' A
little later he complains that he never gets to bed
from her suppers before two or three o'clock.
'In short,' he says, 'I need have the activity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>of a squirrel, and the strength of a Hercules,
to go through my labours,&mdash;not to count how
many <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">démêlés</i> I have had to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raccommode</i> and
how many <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mémoires</i> to present against Tonton,<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
who grows the greater favourite the more people
he devours.' But Tonton's mistress is more
worth visiting than ever, he tells Selwyn,
and she is apparently as tireless as of yore.
'Madame du Deffand and I [says another letter]
set out last Sunday at seven in the evening,
to go fifteen miles to a ball, and came back after
supper; and another night, because it was but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>one in the morning when she brought me home,
she ordered the coachman to make the tour of
the Quais, and drive gently because it was so
early.' At last, early in October, he tears himself
away, to be followed almost immediately
by a letter of farewell. Here it is:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Adieu, ce mot est bien triste; souvenez-vous
que vous laissez ici la personne dont vous êtes
le plus aimé, et dont le bonheur et le malheur
consistent dans ce que vous pensez pour elle.
Donnez-moi de vos nouvelles le plus tôt qu'il
sera possible.</p>

<p>'Je me porte bien, j'ai un peu dormi, ma nuit
n'est pas finie; je serai très-exacte au régime,
et j'aurai soin de moi puisque vous vous y
intéressez.'</p>

<p>The correspondence thus resumed was continued
for five years more. Walpole does not
seem to have visited Paris again, and the references
to Madame du Deffand in his general
correspondence are not very frequent. Towards
the middle of 1780, her life was plainly closing
in. In July and August, she complained of
being more than usually languid, and in a letter
of the 22nd of the latter month intimates that
it may be her last, as dictation grows painful to
her. 'Ne vous devant revoir de ma vie,'&mdash;she
says pathetically,&mdash;'je n'ai rien à regretter.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
From this time she kept her bed, and in September
Walpole tells Lady Ossory that he is
trembling at every letter he gets from Paris.
'My dear old friend, I fear, is going!...
To have struggled twenty days at eighty-four
shows such stamina that I have not totally lost
hopes.' On the 24th, however, after a lethargy
of several days, she died quietly, 'without effort
or struggle.' 'Elle a eu la mort la plus douce,'&mdash;says
her faithful and attached secretary,
Wiart,&mdash;'quoique la maladie ait été longue.'
She was buried, at her own wish, in the parish
church of St. Sulpice. By her will she made
her nephew, the Marquis d'Aulan, her heir.
Long since, she had wished Walpole to accept
this character. Thereupon he had threatened
that he would never set foot in Paris again if
she carried out her intention; and it was abandoned.
But she left him the whole of her
manuscripts<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> and books.</p>

<p>As his own letters to her have not been
printed, her death makes no difference in the
amount of his correspondence. The war with
the American Colonies, of which he foresaw
the disastrous results, and the course of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>which he follows to Mann with the greatest
keenness, fully absorbs as much of his time
as he can spare from the vagaries of the
Duchess of Kingston and the doings of the
Duchess of Gloucester. Not many months
before Madame du Deffand died had occurred
the famous Gordon Riots, which, as he was
in London most of the time, naturally occupy
his pen. It was General Conway who, as the
author of <cite>Barnaby Rudge</cite> has not forgotten,
so effectively remonstrated with Lord George
upon the occasion of the visit of the mob to
the House of Commons; and four days later
Walpole chronicles from Berkeley Square the
events of the terrible 'Black Wednesday.'
From the roof of Gloucester House he sees
the blazing prisons,&mdash;a sight he shall not soon
forget. Other subjects for which one dips in
the lucky bag of his records are the defence
of Gibraltar, the trial of Warren Hastings, the
loss of the <cite>Royal George</cite>. But it is generally
in the minor chronicle that he is most diverting.
The last <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon mot</i> of George Selwyn or
Lady Townshend, the newest 'royal pregnancy,'
the details of court ceremonial, the
most recent addition to Strawberry, the endless
stream of anecdote and tittle-tattle which
runs dimpling all the way,&mdash;these are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
themes he loves best; this is the element in
which his easy persiflage delights to disport
itself. He is, above all, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rieur</i>. About his
serious passages there is generally a false
ring, but never when he pours out the gossip
that he loves, and of which he has so inexhaustible
a supply. 'I can sit and amuse
myself with my own memory,' he says to
Mann in February, 1785, 'and yet find new
stores at every audience that I give to it. Then,
for private episodes [he has been speaking of
his knowledge of public events], varieties of
characters, political intrigues, literary anecdotes,
etc., the profusion that I remember is endless;
in short, when I reflect on all I have seen,
heard, read, written, the many idle hours I have
passed, the nights I have wasted playing at
faro, the weeks, nay months, I have spent
in pain, you will not wonder that I almost
think I have, like Pythagoras, been Panthoides
Euphorbus, and have retained one memory in
at least two bodies.'</p>

<p>He was sixty-eight when he wrote the above
letter. Mann was eighty-four, and the long
correspondence&mdash;a correspondence 'not to be
paralleled in the annals of the Post Office'&mdash;was
drawing to a close. 'What Orestes and
Pylades ever wrote to each other for four-and-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>forty
years without meeting?' Walpole asks.
In June, 1786, however, the last letter of the
eight hundred and nine specimens printed by
Cunningham was despatched to Florence.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> In
the following November, Mann died, after a
prolonged illness. He had never visited England,
nor had Walpole set eyes upon him since
he had left him at Florence in May, 1741.
His death followed hard upon that of another
faithful friend (whose gifts, perhaps, hardly
lay in the epistolary line),&mdash;bustling, kindly
Kitty Clive. Her cheerful, ruddy face, 'all
sun and vermilion,' set peacefully in December,
1785, leaving Cliveden vacant, not, as we
shall see, for long.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Earlier still had departed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>another old ally, Cole, the antiquary, and the
lapse of time had in other ways contracted
Walpole's circle. In 1781, Lady Orford had
ended her erratic career at Pisa, leaving her
son a fortune so considerable as to make his
uncle regret vaguely that the sale of the
Houghton pictures had not been delayed for
a few months longer. Three years later, she
was followed by her brother-in-law, Sir Edward
Walpole,&mdash;an occurrence which had the effect
of leaving between Horace Walpole and his
father's title nothing but his lunatic and childless
nephew.</p>

<p>If his relatives and friends were falling
away, however, their places&mdash;the places of the
friends, at least&mdash;were speedily filled again;
and, as a general rule, most of his male favourites
were replaced by women. Pinkerton,
the antiquary, who afterwards published the
<cite>Walpoliana</cite>, is one of the exceptions; and
several of Walpole's letters to him are contained
in that book, and in the volumes of
Pinkerton's own correspondence published by
Dawson Turner in 1830. But Walpole's appetite
for correspondence of the purely literary
kind had somewhat slackened in his old age,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>and it was to the other sex that he turned for
sympathy and solace. He liked them best;
his style suited them; and he wrote to them
with most ease. In July, 1785, he was visited
at Strawberry by Madame de Genlis, who
arrived with her friend Miss Wilkes and the
famous Pamela,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> afterwards Lady Edward Fitzgerald.
Madame de Genlis at this date was
nearing forty, and had lost much of her good
looks. But Walpole seems to have found her
less <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">précieuse</i> and affected than he had anticipated,
and she was, on this occasion, unaccompanied
by the inevitable harp. A later
visit was from Dr. Burney and his daughter
Fanny,&mdash;'Evelina-Cecilia' Walpole calls her,&mdash;a
young lady for whose good sense and
modesty he expresses a genuine admiration.
Miss Burney had not as yet entered upon that
court bondage which was to be so little to
her advantage. Another and more intimate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>acquaintanceship of this period was with Miss
Burney's friend, Hannah More. Hannah
More ultimately became one of Walpole's
correspondents, although scarcely 'so corresponding'
as he wished; and they met frequently
in society when she visited London.
On her side, she seems to have been wholly
fascinated by his wit and conversational
powers; he, on his, was attracted by her
mingled puritanism and vivacity. He writes to
her as 'St. Hannah;' and she, in return, sighs
plaintively over his lack of religion. Yet (she
adds) she 'must do him the justice to say,
that except the delight he has in teasing me
for what he calls over-strictness, I have never
heard a sentence from him which savoured of
infidelity.'<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> He evidently took a great interest
in her works, and indeed in 1789 printed at
his press one of her poems, <cite>Bonner's Ghost</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>His friendship for her endured for the remainder
of his life; and not long before his death he
presented her with a richly bound copy of
Bishop Wilson's <cite>Bible</cite>, with a complimentary
inscription which may be read in the second
volume of her Life and Correspondence.</p>

<p>It was, however, neither the author of <cite>Evelina</cite>
nor the author of <cite>The Manners of the
Great</cite> who was destined to fill the void created
by the death of Madame du Deffand. In the
winter of 1787-8, he had first seen, and a year
later he made the formal acquaintance of, 'two
young ladies of the name of Berry.' They had
a story. Their father, at this time a widower,
had married for love, and had afterwards been
supplanted in the good graces of a rich uncle
by a younger brother who had the generosity
to allow him an annuity of a thousand a year.
In 1783, Mr. Berry had taken his daughters
abroad to Holland, Switzerland, and Italy,
whence, in June, 1785, they had returned, being
then highly cultivated and attractive young
women of two-and-twenty and one-and-twenty
respectively. Three years later, Walpole met
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>them for the second time at the house of a Lady
Herries, the wife of a banker in St. James's
Street. The first time he saw them he 'would
not be acquainted with them, having heard so
much in their praise that he concluded they
would be all pretension.' But on the second
occasion, 'in a very small company,' he sat next
the elder, Mary, 'and found her an angel both
inside and out.' 'Her face'&mdash;he tells Lady
Ossory&mdash;'is formed for a sentimental novel,
but it is ten times fitter for a fifty times better
thing, genteel comedy.' The other sister was
speedily discovered to be nearly as charming.
'They are exceedingly sensible, entirely natural
and unaffected, frank, and, being qualified to
talk on any subject, nothing is so easy and agreeable
as their conversation, nor more apposite
than their answers and observations. The eldest,
I discovered by chance, understands Latin, and
is a perfect Frenchwoman in her language. The
younger draws charmingly, and has copied
admirably Lady Di.'s gipsies,<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> which I lent,
though for the first time of her attempting
colours. They are of pleasing figures: Mary,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>the eldest, sweet, with fine dark eyes that are
very lively when she speaks, with a symmetry
of face that is the more interesting from being
pale; Agnes, the younger, has an agreeable, sensible
countenance, hardly to be called handsome,
but almost. She is less animated than Mary,
but seems, out of deference to her sister, to
speak seldomer; for they dote on each other,
and Mary is always praising her sister's talents.
I must even tell you they dress within the bounds
of fashion, though fashionably; but without the
excrescences and balconies with which modern
hoydens overwhelm and barricade their persons.
In short, good sense, information, simplicity,
and ease characterize the Berrys; and this is
not particularly mine, who am apt to be prejudiced,
but the universal voice of all who know
them.'<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>'This delightful family,' he goes on to say,
'comes to me almost every Sunday evening.
[They were at the time living on Twickenham
Common.] Of the father not much is recorded
beyond the fact that he was 'a little merry man
with a round face,' and (as his eldest daughter
reports) 'an odd inherent easiness in his disposition,'
who seems to have been perfectly
contented in his modest and unobtrusive char<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>acter
of paternal appendage to the favourites.
Walpole's attachment to his new friends grew
rapidly. Only a few days after the date of the
foregoing letter, Mr. Kirgate's press was versifying
in their honour, and they themselves were
already 'his two Straw Berries,' whose praises
he sang to all his friends. He delighted in devising
new titles for them,&mdash;they were his 'twin
wives,' his 'dear Both,' his 'Amours.' For
them in this year he began writing the charming
little volume of <cite>Reminiscences of the Courts of
George the 1st and 2nd</cite>, and in December, 1789,
he dedicated to them his <cite>Catalogue of Strawberry
Hill</cite>. It was not long before he had
secured them a home at Teddington and finally,
when, in 1791, Cliveden became vacant, he prevailed
upon them to become his neighbours.
He afterwards bequeathed the house to them,
and for many years after his death, it was their
summer residence. On either side the acquaintance
was advantageous. His friendship at once
introduced them to the best and most accomplished
fashionable society of their day, while
the charm of their 'company, conversation and
talents' must have inexpressibly sweetened and
softened what, on his part, had begun to grow
more and more a solitary, joyless, and painful
old age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>His establishment of his 'wives' in his immediate
vicinity was not, however, accomplished
without difficulty. For a moment some ill-natured
newspaper gossip, which attributed the
attachment of the Berry family to interested
motives, so justly aroused the indignation of the
elder sister that the whole arrangement threatened
to collapse. But the slight estrangement
thus caused soon passed away; and at the close
of 1791, they took up their abode in Mrs.
Clive's old house, now doubly honoured. On
the 5th of the December in the same year, after
a fresh fit of frenzy, Walpole's nephew died, and
he became fourth Earl of Orford. The new
dignity was by no means a welcome one, and
scarcely compensated for the cares which it
entailed. 'A small estate, loaded with debt,
and of which I do not understand the management,
and am too old to learn; a source of law
suits amongst my near relations, though not
affecting me; endless conversations with lawyers,
and packets of letters to read every day
and answer,&mdash;all this weight of new business
is too much for the rag of life that yet hangs
about me, and was preceded by three weeks of
anxiety about my unfortunate nephew, and a
daily correspondence with physicians and mad-doctors,
falling upon me when I had been out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
of order ever since July.'<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> 'For the other
empty metamorphosis,' he writes to Hannah
More, 'that has happened to the outward man,
you do me justice in concluding that it can do
nothing but tease me; it is being called names
in one's old age. I had rather be my Lord
Mayor, for then I should keep the nickname
but a year; and mine I may retain a little
longer,&mdash;not that at seventy-five I reckon on
becoming my Lord Methusalem.' For some
time he could scarcely bring himself to use his
new signature, and occasionally varied it by
describing himself as 'The uncle of the late
Earl of Orford.' In 1792, he delivered himself,
after the fashion of Cowley, of the following
<cite>Epitaphium vivi Auctoris</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">'An estate and an earldom at seventy-four!</div>
    <div class="verse">Had I sought them or wished them, 'twould add one fear more,&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse">That of making a countess when almost four-score.</div>
    <div class="verse">But Fortune, who scatters her gifts out of season,</div>
    <div class="verse">Though unkind to my limbs, has still left me my reason;</div>
    <div class="verse">And whether she lowers or lifts me, I'll try,</div>
    <div class="verse">In the plain simple style I have lived in, to die:</div>
    <div class="verse">For ambition too humble, for manners too high.'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The last line seems like another of the many
echoes of Goldsmith's <cite>Retaliation</cite>. As for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>fear indicated in the third, it is hinted that this
at one time bade fair to be something more
than a poetical apprehension. If we are to
credit a tradition handed down by Lord Lansdowne,
he had been willing to go through the
form of marriage with either of the Berrys,
merely to secure their society, and to enrich
them, as he had the power of charging the
Orford estate with a jointure of £2000 per
annum. But this can only have been a passing
thought at some moment when their absence,
in Italy or elsewhere, left him more sensitive
to the loss of their gracious and stimulating
presence. He himself was far too keenly alive
to ridicule, and too much in bondage to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les
bienséances</i>, to take a step which could scarcely
escape ill-natured comment; and Mary Berry,
who would certainly have been his preference,
was not only as fully alive as was he to the
shafts of the censorious, but, during the greater
part of her acquaintanceship with him, was,
apparently with his knowledge, warmly attached
to a certain good-looking General
O'Hara, who, a year before Walpole's death,
in November, 1796, definitely proposed. He
had just been appointed Governor of Gibraltar,
and he wished Miss Berry to marry him at
once, and go out with him. This, 'out of con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>sideration
for others,' she declined to do. A
few months later the engagement was broken
off, and she never again saw her soldier admirer.
Whether Lord Orford's comfort went for anything
in this adjournment of her happiness, does
not clearly appear; but it is only reasonable to
suppose that his tenacious desire for her companionship
had its influence in a decision which,
however much it may have been for the best
(and there were those of her friends who regarded
it as a providential escape), was nevertheless
a lifelong source of regret to herself.
When, in 1802, she heard suddenly at the
Opera of O'Hara's death, she fell senseless to
the floor.</p>

<p>The 'late Horace Walpole' never took his
seat in the House of Lords. He continued,
as before, to divide his time between Berkeley
Square and Strawberry, to eulogize his 'wives'
to Lady Ossory, and to watch life from his
beloved Blue Room. Now and then he did
the rare honours of his home to a distinguished
guest,&mdash;in 1793, it was the Duchess of York;
in 1795, Queen Charlotte herself. In the
latter year died his old friend Conway, by
this time a Field-Marshal; and it was evident
at the close of 1796 that his faithful correspondent
would not long survive him. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
ailments had increased, and in the following
January, he wrote his last letter to Lady
Ossory:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Jan. 15, 1797.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">My dear Madam</span>,&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>You distress me infinitely by showing my idle
notes, which I cannot conceive can amuse anybody.
My old-fashioned breeding impels me
every now and then to reply to the letters you
honour me with writing, but in truth very unwillingly,
for I seldom can have anything
particular to say; I scarce go out of my own
house, and then only to two or three very
private places, where I see nobody that really
knows anything, and what I learn comes from
Newspapers, that collect intelligence from
coffee-houses, consequently what I neither
believe nor report. At home I see only a
few charitable elders, except about four-score
nephews and nieces of various ages, who are
each brought to me about once a-year, to stare
at me as the Methusalem of the family, and
they can only speak of their own contemporaries,
which interest me no more than if
they talked of their dolls, or bats and balls.
Must not the result of all this, Madam, make
me a very entertaining correspondent? And
can such letters be worth showing? or can I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
have any spirit when so old, and reduced to
dictate?</p>

<p>Oh! my good Madam, dispense with me
from such a task, and think how it must add
to it to apprehend such letters being shown.
Pray send me no more such laurels, which I
desire no more than their leaves when decked
with a scrap of tinsel, and stuck on twelfth-cakes
that lie on the shop-boards of pastry-cooks
at Christmas. I shall be quite content
with a sprig of rosemary thrown after me, when
the parson of the parish commits my dust to
dust. Till then, pray, Madam, accept the
resignation of your</p>

<p>
Ancient servant,<br />
<span class="smcap">Orford</span>.
</p></div>

<p>Six weeks after the date of the above letter,
he died at his house in Berkeley Square, to
which he had been moved at the close of the
previous year. During the latter days of his
life, he suffered from a cruel lapse of memory,
which led him to suppose himself neglected
even by those who had but just quitted him.
He sank gradually, and expired without pain
on the 2nd of March, 1797, being then in his
eightieth year. He was buried at the family
seat of Houghton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>His fortune, over and above his leases,
amounted to ninety-one thousand pounds.
To each of the Miss Berrys he left the sum
of £4000 for their lives, together with the
house and garden of 'Little Strawberry'
(Cliveden), the long meadow in front of it,
and all the furniture. He also bequeathed to
them and to their father his printed works
and his manuscripts, with discretionary power
to publish. It was understood that the real
editorship was to fall on the elder sister, who
forthwith devoted herself to her task. The
result was the edition, in five quarto volumes,
of Lord Orford's <cite>Works</cite>, which has been so
often referred to during the progress of these
pages, and which appeared in 1798. It was
entirely due to Mary Berry's unremitting care,
her father's share being confined to a final paragraph
in the preface, in which she is eulogized.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>
<p>Strawberry Hill passed to Mrs. Damer for
life, together with £2000 to keep it in repair.
After living in it for some years, she resigned
it, in 1811, to the Countess Dowager of Waldegrave,
in whom the remainder in fee was
vested. It subsequently passed to George,
seventh Earl of Waldegrave, who sold its contents
in 1842. At his death, in 1846, he left
it to his widow, Frances, Countess of Waldegrave,
who married the Rt. Hon. Chichester S.
Parkinson-Fortescue, later Lord Carlingford.
Lady Waldegrave died in 1879; but she had
greatly added to and extended the original
building, besides restoring many of the objects
by which it had been decorated in Walpole's
day.</p>

<p>When, in October, 1833, Lord (then Mr.)
Macaulay completed for the <cite>Edinburgh</cite>
his review of Lord Dover's edition of Walpole's
letters to Sir Horace Mann, he had apparently
performed to his entire satisfaction the operation
known, in the workmanlike vocabulary of
the time, as 'dusting the jacket' of his unfortunate
reviewee. 'I was up at four this morning
to put the last touch to it,' he tells his sister
Hannah. 'I often differ with the majority
about other people's writings, and still oftener
about my own; and therefore I may very likely
be mistaken; but I think that this article will
be a hit.... Nothing ever cost me more
pains than the first half; I never wrote anything
so flowingly as the latter half; and I like the
latter half the best. [The latter half, it should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
be stated, was a rapid and very brilliant sketch
of Sir Robert Walpole; the earlier, which
involved so much labour, was the portrait of
Sir Robert's youngest son.] I have laid it on
Walpole [<i>i. e.</i>, Horace Walpole] so unsparingly,'
he goes on to say, 'that I shall not be
surprised if Miss Berry should cut me....
Neither am I sure that Lord and Lady Holland
will be well pleased.'<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>His later letters show him to have been a
true prophet. Macvey Napier, then the editor
of the 'Blue and Yellow,' was enthusiastic,
praising the article 'in terms absolutely extravagant.'
'He says that it is the best that I
ever wrote,' the critic tells his favourite correspondent,&mdash;a
statement which at this date must
be qualified by the fact that he penned some
of his most famous essays subsequent to its
appearance. On the other hand, Miss Berry
resented the review so much that Sir Stratford
Canning advised its author not to go near her.
But apparently her anger was soon dispelled,
for the same letter which makes this announcement
relates that she was already appeased.
Lady Holland, too, was 'in a rage,' though
with what part of the article does not transpire,
while her good-natured husband told Macaulay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>privately that he quite agreed with him, but that
they had better not discuss the subject. Lady
Holland's irritation was probably prompted by
her intimacy with the Waldegrave family, to
whom the letters edited by Lord Dover belonged,
and for whose benefit they were published.
But, as Macaulay said justly, his
article was surely not calculated to injure the
sale of the book. Her imperious ladyship's
displeasure, however, like that of Miss Berry,
was of brief duration. Macaulay was too
necessary to her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réunions</i> to be long exiled
from her little court.</p>

<p>Among those who occupy themselves in such
enquiries, it has been matter for speculation
what particular grudge Macaulay could have
cherished against Horace Walpole when, to
use his own expression, he laid it on him 'so
unsparingly.' To this his correspondence affords
no clue. Mr. Cunningham holds that
he did it 'to revenge the dislike which Walpole
bore to the Bedford faction, the followers
of Fox and the Shelburne school.' It is possible,
as another authority has suggested, that
'in the Whig circles of Macaulay's time, there
existed a traditional grudge against Horace
Walpole,' owing to obscure political causes
connected with his influence over his friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Conway. But these reasons do not seem
relevant enough to make Macaulay's famous
onslaught a mere <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vendetta</i>. It is more reasonable
to suppose that between his avowed
delight in Walpole as a letter-writer, and his
robust contempt for him as an individual, he
found a subject to his hand, which admitted
of all the brilliant antithesis and sparkle of
epigram which he lavished upon it. Walpole's
trivialities and eccentricities, his whims
and affectations, are seized with remorseless
skill, and presented with all the rhetorical
advantages with which the writer so well knew
how to invest them. As regards his literary
estimate, the truth of the picture can scarcely
be gainsaid; but the personal character, as
Walpole's surviving friends felt, is certainly
too much <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en noir</i>. Miss Berry, indeed, in her
'Advertisement' to vol. vi. of Wright's edition
of the <cite>Letters</cite>, raised a gentle cry of expostulation
against the entire representation. She
laid stress upon the fact that Macaulay had
not known Walpole in the flesh (a disqualification
to which too much weight may easily
be assigned); she dwelt upon the warmth of
Walpole's attachments; she contested the
charge of affectation; and, in short, made such
a gallant attempt at a defence as her loyalty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
to her old friend enabled her to offer. Yet, if
Macaulay had never known Walpole at all,
she herself, it might be urged, had only known
him in his old age. Upon the whole, 'with
due allowance for a spice of critical pepper
on one hand, and a handful of friendly rosemary
on the other,' as Croker says, both
characters are 'substantially true.' Under
Macaulay's brush Walpole is depicted as he
appeared to that critic's masculine and (for the
nonce) unsympathetic spirit; in Miss Berry's
picture, the likeness is touched with a pencil at
once grateful, affectionate, and indulgent. The
biographer of to-day, who is neither endeavouring
to portray Walpole in his most favourable
aspect, nor preoccupied (as Cunningham supposed
the great Whig essayist to have been)
with what would be thought of his work 'at
Woburn, at Kensington, and in Berkeley
Square,' may safely borrow details from the
delineation of either artist.</p>

<p>Of portraits of Walpole (not in words) there
is no lack. Besides that belonging to Mrs.
Bedford, described at p. <a href="#Page_11">11</a>, there is the enamel
by Zincke painted in 1745, which is reproduced
at p. 71 of vol. i. of Cunningham's edition
of the letters. There is another portrait of him
by Nathaniel Hone, R.A., in the National<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Portrait Gallery. A more characteristic presentment
than any of these is the little drawing by
Müntz which shows his patron sitting in the
Library at Strawberry, with the Thames and a
passing barge seen through the open window.
But his most interesting portraits are two which
exhibit him in manhood and old age. One is
the half-length by J. G. Eckardt which once
hung in its black-and-gold frame in the Blue
Bedchamber, near the companion pictures of
Gray and Bentley.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Like these, it was 'from
Vandyck,' that is to say, it was in a costume
copied from that painter, and depicts the sitter
in a laced collar and ruffles, leaning upon a copy
of the <cite>Ædes Walpolianæ</cite>, with a view of part
of the Gothic castle in the distance. The
canvas bears at the back the date of 1754, so
that it represents him at the age of seven-and-thirty.
The shaven face is rather lean than thin,
the forehead high, the brown hair brushed back
and slightly curled. The eyes are dark, bright,
and intelligent, and the small mouth wears a
slight smile. The other, a drawing made for
Samuel Lysons by Sir Thomas Lawrence, is that
of a much older man, having been executed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>1796. The eyelids droop wearily, the thin lips
have a pinched, mechanical urbanity, and the
features are worn by years and ill-health. It
was reproduced by T. Evans as a frontispiece
for vol. i. of his works. There are other portraits
by Reynolds, 1757 (which McArdell and
Reading engraved), by Rosalba, Falconet, and
Dance;<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> but it is sufficient to have indicated
those mentioned above.</p>

<p>Of the Walpole of later years there are more
descriptions than one, and among these, that
given by Miss Hawkins, the daughter of the
pompous author of the <cite>History of Music</cite>, is, if
the most familiar, also the most graphic. Sir
John Hawkins was Walpole's neighbour at
Twickenham House, and the <cite>History</cite> is said to
have been undertaken at Walpole's instance.
Miss Hawkins's description is of Walpole as
she recalled him before 1772. 'His figure,'
she says, ' ... was not merely tall, but more
properly <em>long</em> and slender to excess; his complexion,
and particularly his hands, of a most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>unhealthy paleness.... His eyes were remarkably
bright and penetrating, very dark and
lively; his voice was not strong, but his tones
were extremely pleasant, and, if I may so say,
highly gentlemanly. I do not remember his
common gait;<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> he always entered a room in
that style of affected delicacy, which fashion
had then made almost natural,&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chapeau bras</i>
between his hands as if he wished to compress
it, or under his arm, knees bent, and feet on
tip-toe, as if afraid of a wet floor. His dress
in visiting was most usually, in summer when I
most saw him, a lavender suit, the waistcoat
embroidered with a little silver, or of white silk
worked in the tambour, partridge silk stockings,
and gold buckles, ruffles and frill generally lace.
I remember when a child, thinking him very
much under-dressed if at any time, except in
mourning, he wore hemmed cambric. In summer
no powder, but his wig combed straight,
and showing his very smooth pale forehead, and
queued behind; in winter powder.'<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>Pinkerton, who knew Walpole from 1784
until his death, and whose disappointment of a
legacy is supposed, in places, to have mingled
a more than justifiable amount of gall with his
ink, has nevertheless left a number of interesting
particulars respecting his habits and personal
characteristics. They are too long to quote
entire, but are, at the same time, too picturesque
to be greatly compressed. He contradicts
Miss Hawkins in one respect, for he says
Walpole was 'short and slender,' but 'compact
and neatly formed,'&mdash;an account which
is confirmed by Müntz's full-length. 'When
viewed from behind, he had somewhat of a
boyish appearance, owing to the form of his
person, and the simplicity of his dress.' None
of his pictures, says Pinkerton, 'express the
placid goodness of his eyes,<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> which would often
sparkle with sudden rays of wit, or dart forth
flashes of the most keen and intuitive intelligence.
His laugh was forced and uncouth, and
even his smile not the most pleasing.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>
<p>'His walk was enfeebled by the gout;
which, if the editor's memory do not deceive,
he mentioned that he had been tormented
with since the age of twenty-five; adding,
at the same time, that it was no hereditary
complaint, his father, Sir Robert Walpole,
who always drank ale, never having known
that disorder, and far less his other parent.
This painful complaint not only affected his
feet, but attacked his hands to such a degree
that his fingers were always swelled and deformed,
and discharged large chalk-stones once
or twice a year; upon which occasions he
would observe, with a smile, that he must
set up an inn, for he could chalk up a score
with more ease and rapidity than any man in
England.'</p>

<p>After referring to the strict temperance of
his life, Pinkerton goes on:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Though he sat up very late, either writing
or conversing, he generally rose about nine
o'clock, and appeared in the breakfast room,
his constant and chosen apartment, with fine
vistos towards the Thames. His approach
was proclaimed, and attended, by a favourite
little dog, the legacy of the Marquise du
Deffand,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> and which ease and attention had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>rendered so fat that it could hardly move.
This was placed beside him on a small sofa;
the tea-kettle, stand, and heater were brought
in, and he drank two or three cups of that
liquor out of most rare and precious ancient
porcelain of Japan, of a fine white, embossed
with large leaves. The account of his china
cabinet, in his description of his villa, will
show how rich he was in that elegant luxury....
The loaf and butter were not spared, ...
and the dog and the squirrels had a liberal
share of his repast.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>'Dinner [his hour for which was four] was
served up in the small parlour, or large dining
room, as it happened: in winter generally the
former. His valet supported him downstairs;<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
and he ate most moderately of chicken, pheasant,
or any light food. Pastry he disliked, as
difficult of digestion, though he would taste a
morsel of venison pye. Never, but once that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
he drank two glasses of white-wine, did the
editor see him taste any liquor, except ice-water.
A pail of ice was placed under the
table, in which stood a decanter of water, from
which he supplied himself with his favourite
beverage....</p>

<p>'If his guest liked even a moderate quantity
of wine, he must have called for it during
dinner, for almost instantly after he rang the
bell to order coffee upstairs. Thither he
would pass about five o'clock; and generally
resuming his place on the sofa, would sit till
two o'clock in the morning, in miscellaneous
chit-chat, full of singular anecdotes, strokes of
wit, and acute observations, occasionally sending
for books or curiosities, or passing to the
library, as any reference happened to arise
in conversation. After his coffee he tasted
nothing; but the snuff box of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tabac d'étrennes</i>
from Fribourg's was not forgotten, and was
replenished from a canister lodged in an ancient
marble urn of great thickness, which stood
in the window seat, and served to secure its
moisture and rich flavour.</p>

<p>'Such was a private rainy day of Horace
Walpole. The forenoon quickly passed in
roaming through the numerous apartments
of the house, in which, after twenty visits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
still something new would occur; and he was
indeed constantly adding fresh acquisitions.
Sometimes a walk in the grounds would intervene,
on which occasions he would go out
in his slippers through a thick dew; and he
never wore a hat. He said that, on his first
visit to Paris, he was ashamed of his effeminacy,
when he saw every little meagre Frenchman,
whom even he could have thrown down
with a breath, walking without a hat, which
he could not do, without a certainty of that
disease, which the Germans say is endemial
in England, and is termed by the natives
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le-catch-cold</i>.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> The first trial cost him a slight
fever, but he got over it, and never caught
cold afterwards: draughts of air, damp rooms,
windows open at his back, all situations were
alike to him in this respect. He would even
show some little offence at any solicitude,
expressed by his guests on such an occasion,
as an idea arising from the seeming tenderness
of his frame; and would say, with a half smile
of good-humoured crossness, "My back is the
same with my face, and my neck is like my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>nose."<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> His iced water he not only regarded
as a preservative from such an accident, but he
would sometimes observe that he thought his
stomach and bowels would last longer than his
bones; such conscious vigour and strength in
those parts did he feel from the use of that
beverage.'<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>The only particular that Cunningham adds to
this chronicle of his habits is one too characteristic
of the man to be omitted. After dinner at
Strawberry, he says, the smell was removed by
'a censer or pot of frankincense.' According
to the <cite>Description</cite>, etc., there was a tripod of
ormolu kept in the Breakfast Room for this
purpose. It is difficult to identify the 'ancient
marble urn of great thickness' in which the
snuff was stored; but it may have been that 'of
granite, brought from one of the Greek Islands,
and given to Sir Robert Walpole by Sir Charles
Wager,' which also figures in the Catalogue.</p>

<p>Walpole's character may be considered in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>fourfold aspect, as a man, a virtuoso, a politician,
and an author. The first is the least easy to
describe. What strikes one most forcibly is,
that he was primarily and before all an aristocrat,
or, as in his own day he would have been
called, a 'person of quality,' whose warmest
sympathies were reserved for those of his own
rank. Out of the charmed circle of the peerage
and baronetage, he had few strong connections;
and although in middle life he corresponded
voluminously with antiquaries such as Cole and
Zouch, and in the languor of his old age turned
eagerly to the renovating society of young
women such as Hannah More and the Miss
Berrys, however high his heart may have placed
them, it may be doubted whether his head ever
quite exalted them to the level of Lady Caroline
Petersham, or Lady Ossory, or Her Grace of
Gloucester. In a measure, this would also
account for his unsympathetic attitude to some
of the great <em>literati</em> of his day. With Gray he
had been at school and college, which made a
difference; but he no doubt regarded Fielding
and Hogarth and Goldsmith and Johnson, apart
from their confessed hostility to 'high life' and
his beloved 'genteel comedy,' as gifted but undesirable
outsiders,&mdash;'horn-handed breakers of
the glebe' in Art and Letters,&mdash;with whom it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
would be impossible to be as intimately familiar
as one could be with such glorified amateurs as
Bunbury and Lady Lucan and Lady Di. Beauclerk,
who were all more or less born in the
purple. To the friends of his own class he was
constant and considerate, and he seems to have
cherished a genuine affection for Conway,
George Montagu, and Sir Horace Mann. With
regard to Gray, his relations, it would seem,
were rather those of intellectual affinity and
esteem than downright affection. But his closest
friends were women. In them, that is, in the
women of his time, he found just that atmosphere
of sunshine and <em>insouciance</em>,&mdash;those conversational
'lilacs and nightingales,'&mdash;in which
his soul delighted, and which were most congenial
to his restless intelligence and easily
fatigued temperament. To have seen him at
his best, one should have listened to him, not
when he was playing the antiquary with Ducarel
or Conyers Middleton, but gossipping of ancient
green-room scandals at Cliveden, or explaining
the mysteries of the 'Officina Arbuteana' to
Madame de Boufflers or Lady Townshend, or
delighting Mary and Agnes Berry, in the half-light
of the Round Drawing Room at Strawberry,
with his old stories of Lady Suffolk and
Lady Hervey, and of the monstrous raven, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
guise of which the disembodied spirit of His
Majesty King George the First was supposed
to have revisited the disconsolate Duchess of
Kendal. Comprehending thoroughly that cardinal
precept of conversation,&mdash;'never to weary
your hearer,'&mdash;he was an admirable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raconteur</i>;
and his excellent memory, shrewd perceptions,
and volatile wit&mdash;all the more piquant for its
never-failing mixture of well-bred malice&mdash;must
have made him a most captivating companion.
If, as Scott says, his temper was 'precarious,'
it is more charitable to remember that in middle
and later life he was nearly always tormented
with a malady seldom favourable to good
humour, than to explain the less amiable details
of his conduct (as does Mr. Croker) by the
hereditary taint of insanity. In a life of eighty
years many hot friendships cool, even with
tempers not 'precarious.' As regards the
charges sometimes made against him of coldness
and want of generosity, very good evidence
would be required before they could be held to
be established; and a man is not necessarily
niggardly because his benefactions do not come
up to the standard of all the predatory members
of the community. It is besides clear, as Conway
and Madame du Deffand would have testified,
that he could be royally generous when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
necessity required. That he was careful rather
than lavish in his expenditure must be admitted.
It may be added that he was very much in
bondage to public opinion, and morbidly sensitive
to ridicule.</p>

<p>As a virtuoso and amateur, his position is a
mixed one. He was certainly widely different
from that typical art connoisseur of his day,&mdash;the
butt of Goldsmith and of Reynolds,&mdash;who travelled
the Grand Tour to litter a gallery at home
with broken-nosed busts and the rubbish of the
Roman picture-factories. As the preface to the
<cite>Ædes Walpolianæ</cite> showed, he really knew
something about painting, in fact was a capable
draughtsman himself; and besides, through Mann
and others, had enjoyed exceptional opportunities
for procuring genuine antiques. But his
collection was not so rich in this way as might
have been anticipated; and his portraits, his
china, and his miniatures were probably his best
possessions. For the rest, he was an indiscriminate
rather than an eclectic collector; and there
was also considerable truth in that strange 'attraction
from the great to the little, and from
the useful to the odd,' which Macaulay has
noted. Many of the marvels at Strawberry
would never have found a place in the treasure-houses&mdash;say
of Beckford or Samuel Rogers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
It is difficult to fancy Bermingham's fables in
paper on looking-glass, or Hubert's cardcuttings,
or the fragile mosaics of Mrs. Delany either at
Fonthill or St. James's Place. At the same
time, it should be remembered that several of
the most trivial or least defensible objects were
presents which possibly reflected rather the
charity of the recipient than the good taste of
the giver. All the articles over which Macaulay
lingers&mdash;Wolsey's hat, Van Tromp's pipe-case,
and King William's spurs&mdash;were obtained in
this way; and (with a laugher) Horace Walpole,
who laughed a good deal himself, would probably
have made as merry as the most mirth-loving
spectator could have desired. But such items
gave a heterogeneous character to the gathering,
and turned what might have been a model
museum into an old curiosity-shop. In any
case, however, it was a memorable curiosity-shop,
and in this modern era of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bric-à-brac</i>
would probably attract far more serious attention
than it did in those practical and pre-æsthetic
days of 1842, when it fell under the hammer of
George Robins.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>
<p>Walpole's record as a politician is a brief one,
and if his influence upon the questions of his
time was of any importance, it must have been
exercised unobtrusively. During the period of
the 'great Walpolean battle,' as Junius styled
the struggle that culminated in the downfall of
Lord Orford, he was a fairly regular attendant
in the House of Commons; and, as we have
seen, spoke in his father's behalf when the
motion was made for an enquiry into his conduct.
Nine years later, he moved the address,
and a few years later still, delivered a speech
upon the employment of Swiss Regiments in the
Colonies. Finally he resigned his 'senatorial
dignity,' quitting the scene with the valediction
of those who depreciate what they no longer
desire to retain. 'What could I see but sons
and grandsons playing over the same knaveries,
that I have seen their fathers and grandfathers
act? Could I hear oratory beyond my Lord
Chatham's? Will there ever be parts equal to
Charles Townshend's? Will George Grenville
cease to be the most tiresome of beings?'<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> In
his earlier days he was a violent Whig,&mdash;at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>times almost a Republican' (to which latter
phase of his opinions must be attributed the
transformation of King Charles's death-warrant
into 'Major Charta'); 'in his old and enfeebled
age,' says Miss Berry, 'the horrors of the
first French Revolution made him a Tory;
while he always lamented, as one of the worst
effects of its excesses, that they must necessarily
retard to a distant period the progress
and establishment of religious liberty.' He
deplored the American War, and disapproved
the Slave Trade; but, in sum, it is to be suspected
that his main interest in politics, after
his father's death, and apart from the preservation
throughout an 'age of small factions' of
his own uncertain sinecures, was the good and
ill fortune of the handsome and amiable, but
moderately eminent statesman, General Conway.
It was for Conway that he took his most active
steps in the direction of political intrigue; and
perhaps his most important political utterance is
the <cite>Counter Address to the Public on the late
Dismission of a General Officer</cite>, which was
prompted by Conway's deprivation of his command
for voting in the opposition with himself
in the debate upon the illegality of general warrants.
Whether he would have taken office if
it had been offered to him, may be a question;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
but his attitude, as disclosed by his letters, is a
rather hesitating <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nolo episcopari</i>. The most interesting
result of his connection with public affairs
is the series of sketches of political men dispersed
through his correspondence, and through
the posthumous <cite>Memoirs</cite> published by Lord
Holland and Sir Denis Le Marchant. Making
every allowance for his prejudices and partisanship
(and of neither can Walpole be acquitted),
it is impossible not to regard these latter as
highly important contributions to historical literature.
Even Mr. Croker admits that they
contain 'a considerable portion of voluntary or
involuntary truth;' and such an admission, when
extorted from Lord Beaconsfield's 'Rigby,' of
whom no one can justly say that he was ignorant
of the politics of Walpole's day, has all
the weight which attaches to a testimonial from
the enemy.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>This mention of the <cite>Memoirs</cite> naturally leads
us to that final consideration, the position of
Walpole as an author. Most of the productions
which fill the five bulky volumes given to
the world in 1798 by Miss Berry's pious care
have been referred to in the course of the foregoing
pages, and it is not necessary to recapitulate
them here. The place which they occupy
in English literature was never a large one,
and it has grown smaller with lapse of time.
Walpole, in truth, never took letters with
sufficient seriousness. He was willing enough
to obtain repute, but upon condition that he
should be allowed to despise his calling and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>laugh at 'thoroughness.' If masterpieces could
have been dashed off at a hand-gallop; if
antiquarian studies could have been made of
permanent value by the exercise of mere
elegant facility; if a dramatic reputation could
have been secured by the simple accumulation
of horrors upon Horror's head,&mdash;his might have
been a great literary name. But it is not thus
the severer Muses are cultivated; and Walpole's
mood was too variable, his industry too
intermittent, his fine-gentleman self-consciousness
too inveterate, to admit of his producing
anything that (as one of his critics has said)
deserves a higher title than '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">opuscula</i>.' His
essays in the <cite>World</cite> lead one to think that he
might have made a more than respectable
essayist, if he had not fallen upon days in
which that form of writing was practically
outworn; and it is manifest that he would
have been an admirable writer of familiar
poetry if he could have forgotten the fallacy
(exposed by Johnson)<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> that easy verse is easy
to write. Nevertheless, in the Gothic romance
which was suggested by his Gothic castle&mdash;for,
to speak paradoxically, Strawberry Hill is
almost as much as Walpole the author of the
<cite>Castle of Otranto</cite>&mdash;he managed to initiate a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>new form of fiction; and by decorating 'with
gay strings the gatherings of Vertue' he preserved
serviceably, in the <cite>Anecdotes of Painting</cite>,
a mass of curious, if sometimes uncritical, information
which, in other circumstances, must
have been hopelessly lost. If anything else
of his professed literary work is worthy of
recollection, it must be a happy squib such as
the <cite>Letter of Xo Ho</cite>, a fable such as <cite>The Entail</cite>,
or an essay such as the pamphlet on Landscape
Gardening, which even Croker allows to be 'a
very elegant history and happy elucidation of
that charming art.'<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>But it is not by his professedly literary work
that he has acquired the reputation which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>retains and must continue to retain. It is
as a letter-writer that he survives; and it is
upon the vast correspondence, of which, even
now, we seem scarcely to have reached the
limits, that is based his surest claim <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">volitare
per ora virum</i>. The qualities which are his
defects in more serious productions become
merits in his correspondence; or, rather, they
cease to be defects. No one looks for prolonged
effort in a gossipping epistle; a weighty
reasoning is less important than a light hand;
and variety pleases more surely than symmetry
of structure. Among the little band of
those who have distinguished themselves in
this way, Walpole is in the foremost rank,&mdash;nay,
if wit and brilliancy, without gravity or
pathos, are to rank highest, he is first. It
matters nothing whether he wrote easily or
with difficulty; whether he did, or did not,
make minutes of apt illustrations or descriptive
incidents: the result is delightful. For
diversity of interest and perpetual entertainment,
for the constant surprises of an unique
species of wit, for happy and unexpected turns
of phrase, for graphic characterization and
clever anecdote, for playfulness, pungency,
irony, persiflage, there is nothing in English
like his correspondence. And when one re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>members
that, in addition, this correspondence
constitutes a sixty-years' social chronicle of a
specially picturesque epoch by one of the most
picturesque of picturesque chroniclers, there
can be no need to bespeak any further suffrage
for Horace Walpole's 'incomparable letters.'</p>

    in Pallmall; and J. Graham in the Strand.'
    According to Baker (<cite>Catalogue of Books, etc., printed
    at the Press at Strawberry Hill</cite> [1810]), 40 copies of
    a supplement or Postscript to the <cite>Royal and Noble
    Authors</cite> were printed by Kirgate in 1786. 'In
    April, 1758, was finished the first impression of my
    "Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors," which I
    had written the preceding year in less than five
    months' (<cite>Short Notes</cite>). 'My book is marvellously
    in fashion, to my great astonishment. I did not
    expect so much truth and such notions of liberty
    would have made their fortune in this our day'
    (<cite>Walpole to Montagu</cite>, 4 May, 1758). 'Dec. 5th
    [1758] was published the second edition of my
    "Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors." Two
    thousand were printed, but <em>not</em> at Strawberry Hill'
    (<cite>Short Notes</cite>). 'I have but two motives for offering
    you the accompanying trifle [<i>i. e.</i>, the Postscript
    above referred to].... Coming from my press, I
    wish it may be added to your Strawberry editions.
    It is so far from being designed for the public that
    I have printed but forty copies' (<cite>Walpole to Hannah

    following particulars from the <cite>Biographia Dramatica</cite>
    as to this book: 'The Author of this Piece
    was the learned, ingenious, and witty <span class="smcap">Lord Cornbury</span>,
    but it was never acted. He made a present
    of it to that great Actress, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Porter</span>, to make
    what Emolument she could by it. And that Lady,
    after his Death, published it by Subscription, at
    Five Shillings, each Book, which was so much
    patronized by the Nobility and Gentry that Three
    Thousand Copies were disposed of. Prefixed to it

    Press at Strawberry-Hill it was printed.' Baker
    adds, 'Mr. Yardley, who when living, kept a Bookseller's
    Shop in New-Inn-Passage, confirmed this
    account, by asserting, that he assisted in printing
    it at that Press.' But Baker nevertheless prefixes
    an asterisk to the title, which implies that it was
    'not printed for Mr. Walpole,' and this probably
    accounts for Richardson's name on the title-page.
    By the subscription list, the Hon. Horace Walpole
    took 21 copies, David Garrick, 38, and Mr. Samuel
    Richardson, of Salisbury Court, 4. All Walpole
    says is, 'About the same time [1758] Mrs. Porter

mother's father [he makes Horace say], was walking
down Norfolk Street in the Strand, to his house there,
just before poor Mountfort the player was killed in that
street, by assassins hired by Lord Mohun. This nobleman,
lying in wait for his prey, came up and embraced Mr.
Shorter by mistake, saying, 'Dear Mountfort!' It was
fortunate that he was instantly undeceived, for Mr. Shorter
had hardly reached his house before the murder took
place' (<cite>Walpoliana</cite>, ii. 96). Mountfort, it will be remembered,
owed his death to Mrs. Bracegirdle's liking for
him.</p></div>

Gothic romance was dedicated, was the youngest daughter
of John, Duke of Argyll and Greenwich. At this date,
she was a widow,&mdash;Lord Coke having died in 1753. Two
volumes of her <cite>Letters and Journals</cite>, with an excellent
introduction by Lady Louisa Stuart, were printed privately
at Edinburgh in 1889 from MSS. in the possession of the
Earl of Home. A third volume, which includes a number
of epistles addressed to her by Walpole, found among
the papers of the late Mr. Drummond Moray of Abercairny,
was issued in 1892. Walpole's tone in these
documents is one of fantastic adoration; but the pair
ultimately (and inevitably) quarrelled. There is a well-known
mezzotint of Lady Mary by McArdell after Allan
Ramsay, in which she appears in white satin, holding a
tall theorbo. The original painting is at Mount Stuart,
and belongs to Lord Bute.</p></div>

of his hitherto unpublished letters to Lady Mary Coke

sight of what, next to Mr. Pitt, has occasioned most alarm
in France, the Beast of the Gévaudan' (<cite>Letters and Journals</cite>,
iii. [1892], xvii). In another letter, to Pitt's sister
Ann, maid of honour to Queen Caroline, he says: 'It is
a very large wolf, to be sure, and they say has twelve teeth
more than any of the species, and six less than the
Czarina' (<cite>Fortescue Corr., Hist. MSS. Commission, 13th

(1716-98), who had visited Twickenham three years
earlier, when he was Ambassador to England. He was
a man of fine manners, and tastes so literary that his
works fill eight volumes. They include a translation of
Walpole's <cite>Essay on Modern Gardening</cite> (see appendix at
end). In his letters to Miss Ann Pitt at this date,
Walpole speaks of the Duke's clever fables, by which he
is now best remembered. Lord Chesterfield told his son
in 1749 that Nivernais was 'one of the prettiest men he
had ever known,' and in 1762 his opinion was unaltered.
'<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. de Nivernais est aimé, respecté, et admiré par tout ce qu'
il y a d'honnêtes gens à la cour et à la ville</i>,' he writes to
Madame de Monconseil. The Duke's end was worthy of
Chesterfield himself, for he spent some of his last hours in
composing valedictory verses to his doctor. (See 'Eighteenth
Century Vignettes,' second series, pp. 107-137.)</p></div>

the editor, Miss Berry, thus describes this picture: It
was 'a washed drawing of Mad. la Duchesse de Choiseul
and Mad. du Deffand, under their assumed characters
of grandmother and granddaughter; Mad. de Choiseul
giving Mad. du Deffand a doll. The scene the interior
of Mad. du Deffand's sitting-room. It was done by M. de
Carmontel, an amateur in the art of painting. He was
reader to the Prince of Condé, and author of several little
Theatrical pieces.' It is engraved as the frontispiece of
vol. vii. of Walpole's <cite>Letters</cite>, by Cunningham, 1857-59.
Mad. du Deffand's portrait was said to be extremely like;
that of the Duchess was not good.</p></div>

(<cite>Corr.</cite>, ix. xv), Mann's letters to Walpole are 'absolutely
unreadable.' An attempt to skim the cream of them
(such as it is) was made by Dr. Doran in two volumes
entitled <cite>'Mann' and Manners at the Court of Florence</cite>,
1740-1786, Bentley, 1876.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_185_185" id="Footnote_185_185"></a><a href="#FNanchor_185_185"><span class="label">[185]</span></a> Mrs. Clive is buried at Twickenham, where a mural
slab was erected to her in the parish church by her
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégée</i> and successor, Miss Jane Pope, the clever actress
who shed tears over the Beauclerk drawings (see p. <a href="#Page_244">244</a>).
Her portrait by Davison, which is engraved as the frontispiece
to Cunningham's fourth volume, hung in the
Round Bedchamber at Strawberry. It was given to
Walpole by her brother, James Raftor.</p></div>

very like herself in the face,' says Walpole, referring
to a then current scandal. At this date, however, it is
but just to add that the recent investigations of Mr. J. G.
Alger, as embodied in vol. xix. of the <cite>Dictionary of
National Biography</cite>, tend to show that it is by no means
certain that Pamela was the daughter of the accomplished
lady whom Philippe <em>Egalité</em> entrusted with the education
of his sons.</p></div>

he said to Pinkerton. 'It is gloomy, uncomfortable;
and, in my eye, unnatural and irrational. It certainly
requires more credulity to believe that there is no God,
than to believe that there is' (<cite>Walpoliana</cite>, i. 75-6). But
Pinkerton must be taken with caution. (Cf. <cite>Quarterly
Review</cite>, 1843, lxxii. 551.)</p></div>

etc., with a highly complimentary Preface, in which she
says: 'I should be unjust to your very engaging and
well-bred turn of wit, if I did not declare that, among all
the lively and brilliant things I have heard from you, I
do not remember ever to have heard an unkind or an
ungenerous one.'</p></div>

H. F. Chorley (<cite>Autobiography</cite>, etc., 1873, vol. i., p. 276)

'the only faithful representation of him [Walpole].'
Against this must be set the fact that it was not selected

it is certainly far less pleasing than the Lawrence.</p></div>

'Walking is not one of my excellences,' he writes. 'In my

last Ten Years of the Reign of King George II.</cite> Edited
by Lord Holland. 2 vols. 4to., 1822; and <cite>Memoirs of the
Reign of King George III.</cite> Edited, with Notes, by Sir
Denis Le Marchant, Bart. 4 vols. 8vo., 1845. Both were
reviewed, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">more suo</i>, by Mr. Croker in the <cite>Quarterly</cite>, with
the main intention of proving that all Walpole's pictures
of his contemporaries were coloured and distorted by
successive disappointments arising out of his solicitude
concerning the patent places from which he derived his
income,&mdash;in other words (Mr. Croker's words!), that
'the whole is "a copious polyglot of spleen."' Such an
investigation was in the favourite line of the critic, and
might be expected to result in a formidable indictment.
But the best judges hold it to have been exaggerated, and
to-day the method of Mr Croker is more or less discredited.
Indeed, it is an instance of those quaint revenges
of the whirligig of Time, that some of his utterances are
really more applicable to himself than to Walpole. 'His
[Walpole's] natural inclination [says Croker] was to grope
an obscure way through mazes and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">souterrains</i> rather than
walk the high road by daylight. He is never satisfied
with the plain and obvious cause of any effect, and is
for ever striving after some tortuous solution.' This is
precisely what unkind modern critics affirm of the Rt.
Honourable John Wilson Croker.</p></div>

destroyed in France and elsewhere; and Scotch and
English gardeners were in demand all over Europe to

taste in a matter of design has taken hold on the

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
